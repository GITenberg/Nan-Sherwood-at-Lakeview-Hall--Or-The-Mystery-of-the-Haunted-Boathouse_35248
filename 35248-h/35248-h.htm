<h1>NAN SHERWOOD AT <br />
LAKEVIEW HALL</h1>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I"></a>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE BRAND NEW BAG</small></h2>


<p>There would have been no trouble at all, Nan
was sure, had it not been for that new bag.</p>

<p>In the first place it was a present from her Aunt
Kate Sherwood, although Nan purchased it herself.
The purchasing of most of her school outfit
was supervised by Mrs. Harley, at the same time
that her own daughter&rsquo;s was bought, but a few
last purchases were left to the girls and Nan and
Bess certainly had a most delightful time shopping
in Chicago for a week, before they started for
Lakeview Hall.</p>

<p>Of course, Bess&rsquo; mother was right at hand to
advise and guide; otherwise careless Bess would
have bought with prodigal hand, and cautious Nan&rsquo;s
outfit would not have been as well selected as the
girl&rsquo;s absent mother would have desired.</p>

<p>But nobody interfered with the matter of the<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
brand new bag. Nan and her chum went to one
of the smartest leather-goods shops and selected the
shiny, russet-leather beauty without any adult interference
save that of an obliging clerk. Mrs. Henry
Sherwood had saved the money herself and insisted
upon Nan&rsquo;s taking it and purchasing &ldquo;just the handsomest
traveling bag the money would buy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, honey-bird,&rdquo; the good woman said
to her niece, the evening before Nan left Pine Camp&mdash;which
was away up in the Peninsula of Michigan.
&ldquo;You know, honey-bird, money&rsquo;s been scarce with
your Uncle Hen and me for some time back; but
now that the trouble about the Perkins Tract is
settled, and he can go to lumbering again, we&rsquo;ll be
all right.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I honestly do believe, Nan, that if you hadn&rsquo;t
made such a friend of Toby Vanderwiller and of
his wife and his crippled grandson, and if you and
your Cousin Tom hadn&rsquo;t helped Tobe out of the
swamp when he got mired in the big storm, that
maybe the trouble about the boundary line between
your uncle&rsquo;s timber option and Gedney Raffer&rsquo;s
tract, wouldn&rsquo;t have been settled, in court or out,
for a year or two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That being the case,&rdquo; Mrs. Sherwood pursued,
&ldquo;your Uncle Henry and I, and Tom and Rafe,
would have been mighty poor for a long time to
come. Now the prospect&rsquo;s bright before us, child,
and I want you should take this I&rsquo;ve saved from my<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
egg and berry money, and buy you just the handsomest
traveling bag you can get for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em all pictured out in the mail-order
catalogue&mdash;full of brushes, and combs, and cut-glass
bottles to hold sweet scent, and tooth-powder,
and all sorts of didos. That&rsquo;s the kind I want you
to have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! but Aunt Kate!&rdquo; Nan Sherwood said
doubtfully, &ldquo;this is a great deal of money to spend
for a hand bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish &rsquo;twas twice as much!&rdquo; declared the lumberman&rsquo;s
wife, vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Twice as much?&rdquo; Nan gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Then the things could be gold trimmed
instead of only silver. I want you to have the
very nicest bag of any girl going to that big
school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The awe-struck Nan and the delighted Elizabeth
were quite sure that the woman from the Michigan
Peninsula had her wish when they walked out of the
leather-goods shop, the handsome russet bag firmly
clutched by its possessor.</p>

<p>The bag was packed at once, for its purchase was
almost the last bit of shopping there was to do before
the chums from Tillbury left Chicago. Mrs.
Harley rose early in the morning to go with them
to the train. She declared that afterward she intended
going back to the hotel to &ldquo;sleep for a
week.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[4]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather superintend the general fall cleaning
at home than get you two girls ready to go to
boarding school again,&rdquo; she sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve been awfully good to me, Mrs.
Harley,&rdquo; said Nan. &ldquo;My own dear Momsey Sherwood
could have treated me no more kindly. And,
of course, she couldn&rsquo;t have shopped for me so well,
for she has been too much of an invalid for a long
while to take any interest in the shops.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Harley kissed her heartily. &ldquo;You blessed
child!&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re</i> no trouble to suit.
Bess is the finicky person.&rdquo; Her daughter began to
pout. &ldquo;Oh, you are, Miss!&rdquo; and her mother held
up an admonitory finger and shook it at Bess.
&ldquo;Next time I shall buy what I think is proper and
leave you at home while I am buying. Why! these
children nowadays are more fussy about their
frocks, and more insistent upon the style of them,
than their mothers. What I shall do, Elizabeth,
when your little sisters are old enough to go away
to school, I&mdash;do&mdash;not&mdash;see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, by that time,&rdquo; said Bess, the modern, &ldquo;I
shall be &lsquo;out,&rsquo; I hope, and may have really something
to say about my own clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear her!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Harley. &ldquo;It will be
several years yet, young lady, before you will be
&lsquo;out,&rsquo; as you call it, or be allowed to spend your
father&rsquo;s money as lavishly as you would like to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nevertheless she kissed her daughter tenderly,<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
just before the train started, and Bess forgot for a
moment that she was anything but a young girl going
a long way off from a very dear and indulgent
mother. They clung to each other for that tender,
heart-breaking moment, and Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s eyes
overflowed in sympathy.</p>

<p>Nan had been through the same ordeal six
months before, when her own dear mother and
father had started for Scotland, while she left Tillbury
on the very same day for her uncle Henry&rsquo;s
backwoods home in the heart of the Upper Michigan
forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Bess,&rdquo; she begged her chum when
the train was out of the station and the &ldquo;clip, clip,
clip-py-ti-clip&rdquo; of the wheels over the rail joints had
tailed off into a staccato chatter, scarcely discernible
through the steady drumming of the great trucks
under the chair-car. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry. You know,
honey, your mother isn&rsquo;t going to be near as far
from you as my dear Momsey is from me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; sniffed Bess. &ldquo;If I can&rsquo;t see her.
But oh, Nan Sherwood!&rdquo; she added sharply. &ldquo;What
kind of grammar was that you just used&mdash;&lsquo;<i>near as
far</i>&rsquo;? If Mr. Mangel, our high-school principal at
Tillbury, thought you would use such language he
would never have written to Dr. Beulah Prescott
that he considered you entitled to a rating equal
with the remainder of our class.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sniff and turn up your nose, Miss, at my<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
diction,&rdquo; laughed Nan. &ldquo;Your nose is bound to be
red if you keep on&mdash;and your eyes, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it? Are they?&rdquo; gasped Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it&mdash;are they <i>what?&rdquo;</i> demanded Nan, rather
startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my nose and eyes red!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! talk about grammar!&rdquo; ejaculated Nan.
&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t criticise, if I were you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind the English language,&rdquo; begged
Bess. &ldquo;Let me look in your mirror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course, that necessitated the opening of the
brand new bag. Then, when Bess thought she
had discovered a suspicious redness of the tip of her
nose, she must needs use the powder puff which
was one of the wonderful &ldquo;didos&rdquo; among the toilet
requisites in the bag.</p>

<p>While Bess was so busily engaged in restoring
the havoc made upon her fresh young countenance
by her recent emotion, there sounded suddenly a
heavy banging and thumping underneath the chair-car
in which the girls were riding, though not at
their end of the coach.</p>

<p>Nervous people at the rear of the car jumped up
and one or two screamed. Almost instantly the
train began to slow down, with much hissing of
steam and compressed air, and soon came to a complete
stop.</p>

<p>Nan had jumped up, too, but not because she
was frightened. None of the trainmen came in of<span class="pagenum">[7]</span>
whom to ask about the stop and Nan went to the
front door and out into the vestibule. Even the colored
porter was not in sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Nan?&rdquo; Bess asked, still powdering
her nose, for she had been obliged to postpone this
delicate operation until the train had come to its
bumping stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered her chum. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
forward to ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But hardly had she said this, when the rear door
of the car opened and a uniformed attendant said,
speaking clearly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;All passengers are requested to move into the
rear coach, with all hand baggage. This car is to
be taken out of the train at once because of an accident.
All passengers will please move to the rear
coach with hand baggage. Another chair car will
be put in to accommodate you at the junction. All
back to rear coach!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He came through shouting these directions so
that all in the car could hear him. Bess jumped up,
very much excited now, with:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my gracious! Do you hear that, Nan? Do
get down my coat and suit-case. You&rsquo;re taller than
I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her chum good-naturedly did as she was requested
and Bess started down the aisle. Indeed, the
two friends were about the first to leave the chair-car
by the rear door.<span class="pagenum">[8]</span></p>

<p>Just as they got into the vestibule, however, Nan
noticed that her chum&rsquo;s hands were empty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Bess Harley!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my
bag?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your bag?&rdquo; returned Bess, with wide-open eyes.
&ldquo;Why! haven&rsquo;t you brought it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; But there! What was the use? Nan
knew well just how heedless Bess was. There was
positively no good in getting angry with her.
&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; she exclaimed, thrusting the suit-case, the
lunch box, and her chum&rsquo;s own wrap into Bess&rsquo;
hands. &ldquo;Get a seat if you can and hold on to these
while I go back for that bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must have left it right in the chair you sat in,&rdquo;
said Bess, feebly.</p>

<p>Nan did not hear this. She had some trouble in
getting back into the car, for she was stemming the
tide of outflowing passengers.</p>

<p>She reached the spot at last. The more moderately
moving passengers were all about her. On
the floor between two of the chairs was the russet
bag.</p>

<p>Nan seized it quickly and turned to hasten back
to her chum. The aisle was clear for the moment
and she ran.</p>

<p>Almost instantly a shrill voice cried out behind
her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! how dare you? That&rsquo;s <i>my</i> bag. Stop
thief!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[9]</span></p>

<p>Nan Sherwood cast a horrified glance over her
shoulder. Yes! the voice addressed her. An angry
girl, very fussily and expensively dressed, had
started wildly down the car after Nan, and again
she shrieked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop thief!&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[10]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>ALL ABOUT NAN</small></h2>


<p>Nan Sherwood stumbled and would have fallen,
for she could not pick her steps very safely with
her gaze directed behind, had not a firm hand seized
her shoulder. The gentleman who did this may
have been as intent upon detaining the girl as upon
saving her from an overthrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoity-toity!&rdquo; he ejaculated, in a rather querulous
voice. &ldquo;Hoity-toity!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
this I hear? &lsquo;Stop thief&rsquo;? Impossible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was a lean-faced man with a deeply lined
countenance, a big nose, and shell-bowed spectacles
through which his pale, gray eyes twinkled, after
all, in a rather friendly way. Or so the startled
Nan thought in those few seconds that elapsed before
the other girl reached them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; repeated the man, having looked
into Nan&rsquo;s eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it isn&rsquo;t impossible!&rdquo; cried the over-dressed
girl, seizing the handle of the russet bag
and trying to jerk it out of Nan&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;The bold
thing! She <i>is</i> a thief! And see her! She won&rsquo;t
give it up!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[11]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;it&rsquo;s my bag!&rdquo; murmured Nan, horrified
by this utterly unexpected situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not! it&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo; asserted the other girl, striving
with all her might to secure the bag.</p>

<p>But Nan Sherwood was no weakling. In fact,
she was really very strong for her age. And her
spring and summer in the Big Woods had bronzed
her skin almost to the hue of a winter-cured oak-leaf.
Her muscles were as well developed as a
boy&rsquo;s. The angry girl could not get the russet bag
away from Nan&rsquo;s secure grip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait! wait, young ladies!&rdquo; urged the gentleman
with the spectacles that made him look so owl-like.
&ldquo;There must be some mistake here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is!&rdquo; snapped the angry girl. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a mistake
to let a little thief like her ride with respectable
people. I&rsquo;m going to have her arrested! I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
tell my father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>All the time she was thus incoherently accusing
Nan, she was likewise endeavoring to get possession
of the bag. But Nan had no idea of giving
up her Aunt Kate&rsquo;s beautiful present.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why!&rdquo; Nan gasped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine! I
bought it myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a story!&rdquo; shrieked the other girl. &ldquo;A
dowdy little thing like you never owned such a
bag. Look at my card on the handle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That should settle it,&rdquo; said the bespectacled gentleman,
with confidence, and he reached for the bag.<span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>Nan allowed him to take it. To her amazement
he slipped an engraved visiting card out of the
frame set into the bag&rsquo;s handle. Nan almost
dropped. She had not noticed the card during the
struggle and she knew she never had owned a visiting
card like that in her life.</p>

<p>The gentleman held the card very close to his
eyes to read the name engraved upon it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought I recognized you,
Miss Riggs, despite your wild state of alarm. &lsquo;Miss
Linda Riggs,&rsquo;&rdquo; he added, repeating the name on the
card. &ldquo;Quite right. The bag is yours, Miss
Riggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think you would have known <i>that</i>, Professor
Krenner, when I first spoke,&rdquo; snapped the
girl, seizing the bag ungratefully from his hand.
&ldquo;Anybody ought to see what that girl is!&rdquo; and she
eyed poor Nan with a measure of disdain that
might have really pained the Tillbury girl had she
not just then been so much troubled by another
phase of the incident.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! where&mdash;where is <i>my</i> bag, then?&rdquo; Nan
gasped.</p>

<p>Professor Krenner glanced sideways at her. He
was a peculiar old gentleman, and he believed deeply
in his own first impressions. Nan&rsquo;s flushed face,
her wide-open, pained eyes, her quivering lips, told
a story he could not disbelieve. The professor&rsquo;s
mind leaped to a swift conclusion.<span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you sat just there, child?&rdquo; he
asked Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He could see over the heads of the few curious
passengers who had surged around them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was your bag like Miss Riggs&rsquo;?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exactly,&rdquo; breathed Nan.</p>

<p>Just then a soft, drawling voice asked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any ob yo&rsquo; ladies an&rsquo; gemmen done lef&rsquo; a bag?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The porter held out a russet leather traveling bag.
Nan leaped for it with a cry of relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It belongs to the young lady, porter,&rdquo; said Professor
Krenner, authoritatively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the bags are just alike!&rdquo; cried one lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a dowdy thing like her ever
honestly owned a bag like mine in this world!&rdquo;
Linda Riggs exclaimed bitterly, &ldquo;She stole it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another passenger laughed. &ldquo;As far as we
know, my girl, you may have stolen your bag.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How dare you?&rdquo; gasped the dressy girl. &ldquo;I
guess you don&rsquo;t know who my father is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I confess the crass ignorance that engulfs my
mind upon that important point,&rdquo; laughed the unimpressed
man, who looked as though he might be
of some importance himself. &ldquo;Who is your father,
my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is Mr. Henry W. Riggs, and he just about
owns this railroad,&rdquo; said the girl, proudly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of him,&rdquo; agreed the man. &ldquo;And<span class="pagenum">[14]</span>
you may tell him from me that if I owned as much
stock in this road as he is supposed to, I&rsquo;d give the
public better service for its money,&rdquo; and the passengers
went away, laughing at the purse-proud and
arrogant girl.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Nan Sherwood had thanked the porter
for recovering her bag and Professor Krenner
for championing her cause. She did not look again
at the girl who had so hurt and insulted her. But
she was very pale and quiet as she went back to
rejoin her chum, Bess Harley, in the other car.</p>

<p>That was the way of Nan Sherwood. When she
was hurt she never cried over it openly; nor was it
often that she gave vent to a public expression of
anger.</p>

<p>For her age, Nan was strangely self-contained
and competent. Not that she was other than a
real, happy, hearty schoolgirl with a deal more than
her share of animal spirits. She was so very much
alive that it had been hard for her to keep her body
still enough to satisfy her teachers at the Tillbury
High School which, until the middle of the previous
winter, she had attended with her chum.</p>

<p>Bess&rsquo; father was well-to-do and Bess had had
almost everything she really craved since the hour
she was born, being the oldest of the &ldquo;Harley tribe,&rdquo;
as she expressed it. When it was decided that she
should, at the end of her freshman year in high
school, attend the preparatory school for girls,<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
known as Lakeview Hall, Bess was determined that
her chum, Nan Sherwood, should go with her.</p>

<p>But Nan&rsquo;s parents were not situated at all as were
Bess Harley&rsquo;s&mdash;neither financially or otherwise.
Mr. Robert Sherwood had been, for years, foreman
of a department in the Atwater Mills. Suddenly
the mills were closed and Nan&rsquo;s father&mdash;with
multitudes of other people&mdash;found his income cut
off.</p>

<p>He owned a little cottage on Amity Street; but
it was not all paid for, as Nan&rsquo;s mother had been a
semi-invalid for a number of years and much of the
money Mr. Sherwood might have saved, had gone
for medical attention for &ldquo;Momsey,&rdquo; as Nan called
her mother.</p>

<p>But the invalid wife and mother was the bravest
and most cheerful of the three who lived in &ldquo;the
dwelling in amity,&rdquo; as Mr. Sherwood called the
little cottage, and it was she who inspired them to
hope for better times ahead.</p>

<p>Nan could not fail to be benefited in character by
such an example as her mother set; but the girl very
well knew that, in their then present circumstances,
there was no possibility of her entering Lakeview
Hall in the fall with Bess Harley.</p>

<p>This was really a tragic outlook for the school
chums; but in the very darkest hour a letter arrived
from a lawyer, named Andrew Blake, of Edinburgh,
Scotland, stating that a great uncle of Mrs.<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
Sherwood&rsquo;s had recently died, bequeathing her an
estate valued at something like ten thousand pounds.</p>

<p>The only shadow cast upon this delightful prospect
was the fact that Mrs. Sherwood must appear
before the Scotch Court to oppose the claim of more
distant relatives who were trying to break the will.</p>

<p>The doctors had already recommended a sea
voyage for Mrs. Sherwood. Now it seemed a
necessity. But her parents could not take Nan
across the ocean. What should be done with the
troubled girl was the much mooted question, when
there burst in upon the family Mr. Sherwood&rsquo;s
brother from Upper Michigan, a giant lumberman,
who had come to Tillbury to offer any help in his
power to Nan&rsquo;s father in his financial straits.</p>

<p>Immediately upon hearing of the legacy, Mr.
Henry Sherwood declared he would take Nan back
to Pine Camp with him, and in the first volume of
this series, entitled &ldquo;Nan Sherwood at Pine Camp,
or, The Old Lumberman&rsquo;s Secret,&rdquo; are told all Nan&rsquo;s
adventures in the Big Woods during the spring and
summer, and until the time came for her to prepare
to enter Lakeview Hall in September.</p>

<p>For, although the court proceedings regarding
Mr. Hughie Blake&rsquo;s will had not been entirely settled,
money had been advanced by Mr. Andrew
Blake to Mr. Sherwood and the desire of Nan&rsquo;s
heart was to be accomplished. She was now on her
way to Lakeview Hall with Bess Harley; and, as we<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
have seen, she had not gone far on the journey from
Chicago before Adventure overtook her.</p>

<p>This first was not a pleasant adventure, however;
and it brought in its train incidents which colored
all Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s initial semester at Lakeview
Hall.</p>

<small>LINDA RIGGS</small></h2>


<p>When Bess Harley heard about the over-dressed
girl&rsquo;s accusation, and how Nan had been treated,
she wanted to jump right up and &ldquo;give the stuck-up
thing a piece of my mind!&rdquo; as she expressed it.
Bess was very angry indeed, and quite overlooked
the fact, of course, that her own carelessness had
brought the trouble about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have slapped her,&rdquo; declared the vigorous
Bess. &ldquo;Calling you a thief! Why! I couldn&rsquo;t have
kept my hands off of her. Who is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I did not pay much attention to what she
said about herself,&rdquo; Nan replied. &ldquo;Only her name.
That&rsquo;s Riggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s homely enough,&rdquo; scoffed Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is not homely,&rdquo; Nan confessed. &ldquo;That is,
I think she may be quite pretty when she isn&rsquo;t angry.
And she had on a dress that would have made you
gasp, Bess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was it so pretty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but it was of very rich material, and daringly
cut,&rdquo; said her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is she now?&rdquo; demanded Bess, standing<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
up to look over the day coach in which they now
rode, for the chair-car with the broken rod had
been left behind and the train was hurrying on to
the junction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think she went into the dining car, forward,&rdquo;
said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! I wish we had. We could see out
better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we have a nice lunch, you know,&rdquo; Nan
objected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just the same, it&rsquo;s <i>common</i> to eat lunch out of a
shoe-box on a train. I don&rsquo;t know what mother was
thinking of. And we could have seen that girl with
the fancy dress in the dining car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; laughed Nan. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re always crazy
after the styles. I don&rsquo;t wish to see her again, I
assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw such a girl as you,&rdquo; complained her
chum. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re as bold as a lion about some things
and as meek as a mouse about others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s ready laugh was her only reply to this.
She had begun to feel better. The sting of her encounter
with the unkind and vulgar girl was
soothed. She did not mind now the curious glances
of those passengers from the chair-car who were
within the limit of her view.</p>

<p>But Bess considered that one person&rsquo;s interest in
her and her chum was distasteful. She whispered
to Nan.<span class="pagenum">[20]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that old, goggle-eyed gentleman staring
at us, Nan? I declare! Are we a pair of
freaks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he thinks so,&rdquo; chuckled Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s awfully impolite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan smiled frankly at the observant passenger
across the aisle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nancy!&rdquo; gasped Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was kind to me. Professor Krenner is his
name. I heard that girl call him so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then they know each other?&rdquo; said Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I presume so. But that did not keep him from
believing <i>me</i>,&rdquo; Nan said. &ldquo;He was nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; whispered Bess. &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look nice.&rdquo;
She began to giggle. &ldquo;Did you ever see such glasses?
He looks like an owl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose he is a learned man,&rdquo; Nan returned,
&ldquo;so the look of wisdom becomes him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; ejaculated Bess. &ldquo;That does not follow.
What sort of professor did you say he is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say. I only heard his name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Bess, with growing curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Professor Krenner,&rdquo; repeated Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;ee!&rdquo; squealed Bess, suddenly.</p>

<p>She opened her hand-bag, which was quite commodious,
and began frantically to dig into its contents.
A dollar bill, two lozenges, a handkerchief,
part of a paper of chewing gum, an elastic band, a<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
receipt for &ldquo;freckle balm,&rdquo; a carved horsechestnut
that her brother Billy had given her for a keepsake
at parting, two bits of silk she had tried to match
and could not, a tiny piece of sealing-wax, a much-creased
letter (the last Nan had written her from
Pine Camp), a funny little carved piece of ivory
with a toothpick inside, a silver thimble (for Bess
was sometimes domestic), a pair of cuticle scissors
in a case, a visiting card, a strip of torn lace (likewise
saved to &ldquo;match&rdquo;), a big, pearl button off her
coat, a safety pin, and a molasses &ldquo;kiss,&rdquo; fortunately
wrapped in waxed paper, <i>fell to the floor</i>.</p>

<p>Nan patiently picked up the scattered possessions
of her chum. There were other things in the
bag, as Bess, with a squeal of satisfaction, proved
by producing the folded announcement of Lakeview
Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious, Bess!&rdquo; sighed her friend.
&ldquo;How will you ever get all these things back into
that bag?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, tumble &rsquo;em in,&rdquo; said the careless Bess.
&ldquo;There must be room for them, or they would never
have got in there in the first place. But listen here!
I thought I remembered the name. Your Professor
Krenner is on the staff of the school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He teaches higher mathematics and architectural
drawing. &lsquo;Architectural drawing&rsquo;! What
girl wants to take that? Of course, the mathematics<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
is compulsory, but the drawing is elective.
Dear me! he&rsquo;s a sour looking apple.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not when you get close to him,&rdquo; Nan said
quickly. &ldquo;He has kind eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; Bess said again.</p>

<p>The man occupying the seat directly ahead of the
two girls left at the very next station. Immediately
Professor Krenner, who seemed to be much interested
in Nan and Bess, crossed the aisle with his
bag and sat down in the empty seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Miss,&rdquo; he said to Nan, his eyelids wrinkling
at the corners as though a smile lurked behind
the shell-bowed spectacles, &ldquo;I see you have not
allowed that little contretemps to blast all the pleasure
of your journey. Are you and your friend
going to school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. This is my chum, Elizabeth Harley,
Professor Krenner,&rdquo; Nan said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are going to Lakeview Hall,&rdquo; Bess put in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess showed him the printed circular sent out by
Dr. Beulah Prescott. &ldquo;We know all about you,
sir,&rdquo; she said boldly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; he returned, with a rather grim smile
about his wide mouth. &ldquo;Then you know much
more than I know myself, and I hope some day
when we are better acquainted that you will explain
to me, my dear, this complex personality that is
known as Alpheus Krenner.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>Bess flushed a little; but Nan chuckled. She
liked this odd, ugly man, with his querulous voice
and dry way of speaking. The twinkling eyes took
the rough edge off much that he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you are two of the new girls I shall meet in
my mathematics classes this year,&rdquo; he proceeded.
&ldquo;Do you both know your multiplication tables?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Nan demurely, while Bess looked
rather indignant. &ldquo;And we have been a little
farther, too, in arithmetic. But how about the
drawing, sir? Don&rsquo;t you expect to meet us in
those classes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Professor Krenner, soberly. &ldquo;No
girl cares for such instruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; cried Bess, becoming interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never had a single pupil in architectural
drawing at Lakeview Hall,&rdquo; admitted the gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why do they have it in the list of elective
studies?&rdquo; asked Nan, as much puzzled as her chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; said the perfectly serious professor,
&ldquo;Dr. Prescott insists upon each instructor
having two courses&mdash;one study that is compulsory,
and another that is elective. I am not a versatile
man. I might have suggested instruction on the
key-bugle, which I play to the annoyance of my
neighbors; but there is already a musical instructor
at the Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I might have suggested a class in the ancient and<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
honorable calling of cobbling (which is the handmaid
of Philosophy, I believe, for I have found
most cobblers to be philosophers) as I often repair
my own shoes,&rdquo; pursued Professor Krenner, with
the utmost gravity. &ldquo;But there is a lady at the Hall
who will teach you to do very ladylike tricks in
burnt leather, and the two arts might conflict.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, being naturally of a slothful disposition, and
being quite sure that no young girl would care for
architecture, which is my hobby, I suggested my
elective study. I think that Dr. Prescott considers
it a joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess gazed at him with a puzzled expression of
countenance. She did not exactly understand. But
Nan appreciated his dry humor, and her own eyes
danced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I should like to take architectural
drawing,&rdquo; she said demurely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan!&rdquo; gasped Bess.</p>

<p>The professor&rsquo;s eyes twinkled behind the great,
round spectacles. &ldquo;I shall have to guard against
that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;No young lady at the Hall has
ever yet expressed such a desire&mdash;not even your
friend, Miss Riggs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you don&rsquo;t mean to say that that horrid girl
who treated Nan so, goes to Lakeview Hall?&rdquo; Bess
cried out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t, really, does she, sir?&rdquo; asked Nan,
anxiously.<span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Linda Riggs? Oh, yes. Didn&rsquo;t you know
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, me,&rdquo; sighed Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no breach of confidence on my part,&rdquo; replied
the dry professor, &ldquo;for she explains the fact to
everybody, if I tell you that she is the daughter of
Mr. Henry W. Riggs, the railroad magnate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then she must be very rich,&rdquo; almost whispered
Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her father is,&rdquo; Professor Krenner said briefly.</p>

<p>Bess was deeply impressed, it was evident. But
Nan already dreaded the shadow of Linda Riggs&rsquo;
presence in her school life.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[26]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>LUCK AND PLUCK</small></h2>


<p>Nan found Professor Krenner a most amusing
companion. She was eager to hear all she could
from him regarding the school to which she and
Bess Harley were bound.</p>

<p>The several male instructors at Lakeview Hall
did not reside there, but lived near by in the village
of Freeling. That is, the other gentlemen of Dr.
Prescott&rsquo;s staff did so. Professor Krenner, who
was unmarried, lived in a cabin he had built under
the bluff on the lake shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not far from the old boathouse, which is
quite a famous place, by the way, as you will find
when you get to the Hall. I am not troubled much
with visitors because of my proximity to the boathouse.
That is taboo with most of the young
ladies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; queried the curious Bess, promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it is considered to possess one of those
rare birds, a &lsquo;hant,&rsquo;&rdquo; chuckled the professor. &ldquo;By
night, at least, it is given a wide berth by even the
most romantic miss in the school.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! a real ghost?&rdquo; gasped Bess, deliciously excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is quite impossible, is it not?&rdquo; queried Professor
Krenner, in his gentle way of poking fun. &ldquo;A
ghost must necessarily be impalpable; then, how
can it be real?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess did not like being &ldquo;made fun of,&rdquo; so she
whispered to Nan; but the latter liked to hear the
professor talk. That he was an odd man she was
sure; but he was nothing like Toby Vanderwiller,
the lumberman, or the other crude characters she
had met at Pine Camp. What would Bess have said
to Mr. Fen Llewellen, for instance? Or what would
her chum think, even, of her cousin, Tom Sherwood?</p>

<p>Bess soon became anxious for a change and she
begged Nan to come into the dining car for luncheon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we have our lunch,&rdquo; Nan pointed out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care. I don&rsquo;t want a lot of stale sandwiches
and fruit,&rdquo; Bess declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to waste what little money I have,
when your mother bought us a perfectly lovely
lunch,&rdquo; said Nan, cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t nice to eat it here,&rdquo; Bess objected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Other people are doing so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; snapped Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, now, Bess&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a dollar,&rdquo; interrupted Bess. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
see why mother wouldn&rsquo;t let me have more money
while traveling; but she didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good reason,&rdquo; laughed Nan. &ldquo;You know you&rsquo;d
lose it.&rdquo; She failed to tell Bess that Mrs. Harley
had entrusted her with some money to use, &ldquo;if anything
should happen.&rdquo; Nan was dependable and
Bess&rsquo; mother appreciated the fact.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; said Bess, firmly, rising from the
seat. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better come, Nan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On a dollar?&rdquo; declared Nan. &ldquo;How far do you
think you&rsquo;ll get in a dining car with all that
wealth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess made a little face. &ldquo;At least, we can have
some tea,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ex&mdash;cuse me!&rdquo; exclaimed Nan. &ldquo;I have a
hearty appetite&mdash;and it is crying out for satisfaction
right now. I know your mother did not fail
to remember there were two high-school girls to
feed. There is plenty here,&rdquo; and she took down the
ample box which Mrs. Harley&rsquo;s thoughtfulness had
supplied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said her chum, slily. &ldquo;There
will be enough for me if I want some when I
come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; replied Nan, with
gravity. &ldquo;I shall try to eat it all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no quarrel between them over such a
small matter. Indeed, Nan and Bess had never<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
really had a serious difference since they had sat
side by side in the kindergarten.</p>

<p>Bess had a reason for going into the dining car which
she did not explain to her chum. She was
curious about Linda Riggs. Everybody had heard
of Mr. Henry W. Riggs, one of the big railroad
men of the Middle West. Linda, of course, must be
very aristocratic, Bess thought. And she had lots
of money and lots of fine clothes.</p>

<p>Bess was deeply interested in pretty frocks, and
she spent more than a few minutes daily reading the
society column in the paper. She knew that Linda
Riggs had an older sister who was already out in
society. And once Bess had seen a group picture of
the Riggs family. She thought she remembered
Linda as a rather long-legged girl with plenty of
bone and a snub nose.</p>

<p>When she entered the dining car she scarcely
noticed the colored man who bowed her to a seat,
so interested was she in viewing the girl whom she
knew must be the railroad magnate&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>As Nan had intimated, Linda Riggs&rsquo; frock was
stunning. It was not fit for a girl of her age to
wear, it was too loud and, really, somewhat immodest.
But it was evident that Miss Linda Riggs
was quite used to wearing such apparel.</p>

<p>Although she had completed her luncheon some
time before, it was evident that she had no intention<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
of going into the day coach to which the other
dispossessed passengers had been relegated when
the rod broke under the chair-car.</p>

<p>They would soon be at the junction where another
chair-car was to be coupled on.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a waiter was hovering about Linda
Riggs&rsquo; chair. She beckoned him, took the check
nonchalantly, and with a pencil wrote her father&rsquo;s
name upon it, passing both the check and her visiting
card to the negro.</p>

<p>Bess watched breathlessly. It would have been
the height of human delight, in Bess Harley&rsquo;s opinion,
if <i>she</i> could do that.</p>

<p>The head-waiter came and bowed before Linda
Riggs and showed that he appreciated the honor of
her presence in the car. Bess forgot to drink her
tea, and only crumbled her cake while she secretly
watched the arrogant girl.</p>

<p>Bess had felt her anger rise at the unknown girl
who so insulted Nan Sherwood, when first she had
been told about the confusion over the traveling
bags. But having heard the particulars of who
Linda Riggs was, and of her father&rsquo;s riches, Bess&rsquo;
anger on her chum&rsquo;s behalf was soon drowned in
curiosity.</p>

<p>She dawdled over her tea and cake until the train
arrived at the junction, where another chair-car was
in waiting. It was then, when Linda Riggs gathered
up her purse and vanity bag, preparatory to<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
leaving the dining car, that Bess Harley made a
mortifying discovery.</p>

<p>She wished to pay her own modest check. Perhaps
she would get into the corridor of the car at
the same time as the stylishly gowned girl, and
Linda might speak. But clutching her gloves and
looking wildly all about, <i>Bess could not find her
hand-bag</i>.</p>

<p>Had Nan Sherwood had the first suspicion just
then of her chum&rsquo;s predicament she would have
flown to her assistance. But the train had halted,
been broken in two, and the forward part of it had
gone off with the locomotive to couple on to the
waiting chair-car.</p>

<p>Nan asked the brakeman, and learned it would be
ten minutes or more before the train would go on.
The junction was not a very attractive spot; but
already Nan was tired of riding. She asked Professor
Krenner, who was reading, if he would look
out for her baggage, and then she left the car.</p>

<p>Away up on a side track she saw the main part
of the train, puffing down. The station, a weather-beaten,
ugly old building, was not near. Indeed,
there were not half a dozen houses in sight.</p>

<p>There were uncut weeds along the track, the cinderpaths
were baked hard by the sun, and the whole
situation was unlovely.</p>

<p>Near at hand was a shack, as ugly as all the other
buildings; but there seemed to be some life about it.<span class="pagenum">[32]</span></p>

<p>At least, Nan, before she left the car, had seen
the flutter of a child&rsquo;s skirt at the door of the hovel.
She now crossed the tracks and went cautiously
toward the miserable dwelling.</p>

<p>Nan saw the child again at the door of the cabin,
but only for an instant. She shouted to the little
one, but the latter bashfully slipped inside the door.</p>

<p>Nan was very fond of children and this little
towheaded child interested her. There was still
plenty of time before the two halves of the train
would be brought together.</p>

<p>Nan ran across the desert of cinders and weeds
toward the cabin. Nobody else appeared at the
broken window or the open door, but suddenly she
heard an ear-piercing shriek from within.</p>

<p>It was the voice of the child. It sounded from
the loft of the cabin, into which the little girl had
doubtless climbed to escape from Nan&rsquo;s thoughtless
curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s the matter, my
dear?&rdquo; the girl from Tillbury cried, her feet
spurred more quickly toward the cabin beside the
railroad track.</p>

<p>The tiny girl shrieked for the second time&mdash;a
shrill, agonized alarm. A more timid person would
have been halted by the very nature of the cry.
But Nan Sherwood did not hesitate. In a moment
she was at the door of the hovel.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>NAN SAVES ANOTHER, BUT IS HURT HERSELF</small></h2>


<p>Nan looked searchingly into the gloomy interior
of the hut. It was now no home, whatever it may
have been in the past. It was only the wreck of a
dwelling.</p>

<p>The girl could see little at first save the bare floor,
the heaps of rubbish in the corners, and the fact
that the rafters of the floor above were no longer
covered with boards&mdash;if ever they had been.</p>

<p>The ladder which led to the loft was in the far
corner. There was not a stick of furniture in sight.</p>

<p>Suddenly Nan saw something moving in a streak
of dusty sunlight that penetrated the side window.
It was a pair of child&rsquo;s thin legs kicking in the air!</p>

<p>Above the knees was the little torn frock, and,
looking higher, and looking aghast, Nan saw that
the tiny girl was hanging by her hands from the
rafters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear!&rdquo; she began, and stepped over the
broken sill.</p>

<p>Then she halted&mdash;halted as though she had been
frozen in her tracks.</p>

<p>From the floor, almost at Nan&rsquo;s feet, it seemed,<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
came a quick rustle&mdash;then a distinct rattle. The
flat, brisk sound can never be mistaken, not even
by one who has not heard it before. Wide-eyed, her
breath leashed tight behind her teeth, Nan Sherwood
stared about the floor. It was there, the coiled
rattlesnake, almost under the bare, twitching soles
of the hanging child&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p>In these few passing seconds the eyes of the girl
from Tillbury had become so used to the semi-gloom
that she could see the fear-stricken face of
the imperiled child. Horror and despair looked out
of the staring eyes. Her frail arms could not long
hold the weight of her body.</p>

<p>She must drop, and the arrogantly lifted head of
the rattlesnake, crested with wrath, was ready for
the stroke.</p>

<p>In running up the ladder to the loft the child had
doubtless dislodged the rattlesnake which, upon
slipping to the floor of the hut, had assumed an
attitude of defense. The victim, flinging herself
down between two rafters to escape, at once was in
imminent danger of falling upon the angry snake.</p>

<p>The drop to the floor of the shack would not
necessarily hurt the child, for the rafters were low.
But a single injection of the poison of the serpent
might be fatal.</p>

<p>These facts and conjectures had rushed into Nan
Sherwood&rsquo;s mind in a flood of appreciation. She
understood it all.<span class="pagenum">[35]</span></p>

<p>As well, she realized that, if the child was to be
saved, she must perform the act of rescue. Before
she could summon help to the spot the child&rsquo;s hold
would slip and her tender body fall within striking
distance of the snake.</p>

<p>Indeed, it seemed to Nan as though the little
brown fingers were already slipping from the rough
rafter. Her body stiffened as though she would
leap forward to catch the child in her arms, as she
fell.</p>

<p>But such a move might be fatal to herself, Nan
knew. The serpent would change its tactics with
lightning speed. Indeed, it sprang its rattle in
warning again as though, with its beady, lidless
eyes, it read Nan&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>The seconds passed swiftly. The child did not
scream again, but her pleading gaze rested upon
Nan&rsquo;s face. Nan was her only hope&mdash;her only possible
chance of escape.</p>

<p>Nor did Nan fail her.</p>

<p>One glance the girl gave around the doorway.
Then she stooped suddenly, seized upon a huge
stone and hurled it at the upraised, darting crest of
the snake.</p>

<p>Down upon the writhing coils the stone fell
crushingly. The head of the snake was mashed,
and the stone bounded across the floor.</p>

<p>Yet, as Nan leaped in with a cry and caught the
falling child in her arms, a horrible thing happened.<span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>The writhing, twisting body of the already dead
snake coiled around her ankle and for that awful
moment Nan was not at all sure but the poisonous
creature had bitten her!</p>

<p>She staggered out of the hut with the child in her
arms, and there fell weakly to the ground. Professor
Krenner had been watching her from the car
window, wondering at her recent actions. Now he
leaped up and rushed out of the car. Several of
the train crew came running to the spot, too, but
it was the odd instructor who reached the fallen
girl first, with the sobbing child beside her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snake! snake!&rdquo; was all the little one could gasp
at first.</p>

<p>A brakeman ventured into the hut and kicked out
the writhing body of the rattlesnake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great heavens! the girl&rsquo;s been bitten!&rdquo; cried one
man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she saved the kid from it,&rdquo; declared another.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; said Professor Krenner, firmly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not bitten, are you?&rdquo; he asked Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&mdash;I&mdash;thought I was,&rdquo; gasped the girl.
Then she began to laugh hysterically. &ldquo;But if I
was the snake was dead first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would not be impossible,&rdquo; murmured the
professor.</p>

<p>Then he glanced at the crushed head of the rattlesnake,
and felt relieved. &ldquo;That thing never<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
struck after the stone hit it!&rdquo; he declared, with confidence.
&ldquo;You are safe, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s a mighty brave girl,&rdquo; cried one of the
railroad men. &ldquo;I was watching her at the door of
that old shack, and wondered what she was doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Krenner had helped the trembling Nan
to rise and beat the dust off her skirt. The little
girl&rsquo;s sobs soon ceased when she found she was not
hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes the rest of the train, Bill!&rdquo; exclaimed
one of the men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All back to the cars!&rdquo; ordered Bill. &ldquo;All aboard&mdash;them
that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan stooped and kissed the tear-stained face of
the child. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who you are, honey,&rdquo; she
crooned, &ldquo;but I shall remember all the term at Lakeview
that down here at this junction is a little girl
I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; suddenly screamed the child, throwing
her arms about Nan&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;I want you! I
want you! I want my mom to see you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan had to break away and run for the train,
leaving the child screaming after her. Professor
Krenner was already at the car step to help her
aboard. The two parts of the train had come gently
together, and had been coupled. To Nan&rsquo;s amazement,
as she approached the cars, she beheld her
chum, Bess Harley, and the arrogant Linda Riggs,
sitting comfortably together in a window of the<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
chair-car, talking &ldquo;sixteen to the dozen,&rdquo; as Nan
mentally expressed it. So busy was Bess, indeed,
that she did not see Nan running for the train.</p>

<p>When the train had started, however, Bess came
slowly back into the day coach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the other car, Nan,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;Why! how rumpled you look! Did you eat all
that lunch?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; Nan replied, rather seriously. Then,
as she gathered their possessions together for transportation
to the chair-car she, by accident, kicked
her chum&rsquo;s hand-bag out into the aisle. &ldquo;Why!
what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; Nan cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! there it is,&rdquo; Bess said. &ldquo;The horrid thing!
I didn&rsquo;t know what had become of it. And I was
so mortified when I came to pay for my tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan looked at her aghast. &ldquo;Whatever did you
do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>Bess had the grace to blush a little. But then she
laughed, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That Riggs girl isn&rsquo;t
so bad, after all. She saw my difficulty and she
just had my forty-five cents added to her check. It
was real kind of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! I never!&rdquo; was all Nan could say.</p>

<p>She followed Bess forward to the other car in
something of a daze, bearing the bulk of their impedimenta
herself. Bess Harley hobnobbing with<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
the rude girl who had accused her, Nan, of being
a thief! It seemed impossible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Nan asked, as Bess continued
up the aisle. &ldquo;Here are empty seats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is plenty of room up front,&rdquo; said Bess,
cheerfully.</p>

<p>Nan saw Linda Riggs&rsquo; hat &ldquo;up front,&rdquo; too.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said firmly. &ldquo;I shall sit here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well!&rdquo; Bess drawled, pouting.</p>

<p>For the first time in her life Nan Sherwood felt
that a friend was disloyal to her&mdash;in appearance, if
not actually. She realized that Bess must have been
put in an exceedingly mortifying position in the
dining car when she found she was without money
with which to pay her check; and Miss Riggs may
have been quite accommodating to offer to pay.
Nan, however, could not imagine herself in her
chum&rsquo;s situation, accepting the offer.</p>

<p>Bess needed only to wait until the first half of the
train backed down to the rear half, when she could
either have found her mislaid bag, or got the money
for her lunch from Nan.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;to be so eager to continue the acquaintanceship
with the uncivil girl! That was
what pointed the dart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; said the pouting Bess, at last.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to pay her the forty-five cents. She&rsquo;ll
think it funny.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[40]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Pay her by all means,&rdquo; Nan said, striving not to
show how hurt she was.</p>

<p>Bess briskly went up the aisle at this permission;
but she did not return for an hour or more. Linda
Riggs&rsquo; conversation evidently quite charmed shallow,
thoughtless Bess.<span class="pagenum">[41]</span></p>

<small>HOW IT FEELS TO BE A HEROINE</small></h2>


<p>Bess Harley came back to her chair facing
Nan&rsquo;s quite full of a brand new subject of conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Nan Sherwood,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that
we&rsquo;ve got a real, live heroine aboard this train?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Nan. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s she
done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They say she saved another girl&rsquo;s life back there
where we stopped to take on the new car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At the Junction?&rdquo; murmured Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; whispered her chum, and immediately became
silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; ejaculated Bess. &ldquo;I never saw
such a girl. Aren&rsquo;t you interested at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; her chum replied in a very
small voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder at you, Nan Sherwood!&rdquo; cried Bess,
at last, after staring at Nan for some moments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem at all interested. And this girl<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
was awfully brave. Linda says she ought to have a
purse of money given her&mdash;or a Carnegie medal&mdash;or
something. Linda says&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Linda?&rdquo; repeated Nan, in wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; Bess said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s not at all a bad
girl&mdash;nothing at all like what you said she was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> said she was, Bess?&rdquo; asked Nan, gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! you don&rsquo;t like her,&rdquo; flared up Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly do not,&rdquo; confessed Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re prejudiced,&rdquo; pouted her chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I certainly am prejudiced against anybody who
calls me a thief,&rdquo; Nan declared firmly. &ldquo;And so
would you be, Bess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t know you, Nan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I wish never to know her,&rdquo; said Nan, with
spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have to,&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to
the same school we do. She&rsquo;s been there for two
years, you see, and she knows everything,&rdquo; declared
Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everything except how to be kind and polite,&rdquo;
suggested Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you go again!&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t
sound like you at all, Nan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said her chum. &ldquo;I thought you
knew me pretty well by this time, Bess. But, it
seems you know this Linda Riggs better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan! I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; and Bess was almost ready
to cry. &ldquo;She, Linda, was mad when she spoke to<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
you, of course. You ought to hear her speak of
this brave girl back in the day coach, who saved the
other one from the snake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan was silent; but Bess was full of the topic
and the pent up volume of her speech had to find
an outlet. She rushed on with:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was just great of her, Nan! She reminds
me of you when you saved Jacky Newcomb&rsquo;s life
in the pond last winter&mdash;when he broke through
the ice that evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan still was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This girl is just as brave as you were,&rdquo; declared
Bess, with confidence. &ldquo;She got off the train when
it stopped. And she saw a little girl inside a house
there by the railroad track. The little girl was in
there and a great, big rattlesnake was coiled all
ready to strike the poor little thing,&rdquo; went on Bess,
breathlessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The colored porter told Linda and me all about
it. This brave girl threw a stone on the horrid
snake and killed it before it could strike the child.
And then she fainted and they carried her back to
the car,&rdquo; pursued Bess. &ldquo;And the colored man says
the passengers are going to get up a memorial to
present to this girl. I want to see her&mdash;to know
her. Don&rsquo;t you, Nan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; gasped her chum, in much confusion, &ldquo;I
hope they won&rsquo;t do anything like <i>that</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like what?&rdquo; queried Bess, in amazement.<span class="pagenum">[44]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Bother her with any memorial&mdash;or whatever
you call it&mdash;about what she did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you are perfectly horrid!&rdquo; her chum declared.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a heroine! Think of it! We ought
to do something for her, Linda says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ought to let her alone,&rdquo; Nan declared vigorously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I never knew you to speak so, Nan,&rdquo; gasped
Bess. &ldquo;This brave girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know she&rsquo;s brave?&rdquo; snapped Nan,
who was really getting cross. &ldquo;She probably was
scared half to death.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! she&rsquo;s a heroine,&rdquo; declared Bess again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! how do we know how a heroine feels?&rdquo;
Nan asked, exasperated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing I am sure of,&rdquo; went on Nan Sherwood,
rather wildly. &ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t want a memorial&mdash;or
a medal&mdash;or a purse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s poor,&rdquo; put in Bess, obstinately.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;do you know who she is?&rdquo; gasped Bess.</p>

<p>Nan was silent. She saw she had gone too far.
If Bess should suspect&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The door at the rear of the car banged open. The
conductor, leading a committee of passengers from
the other coach, entered. He was smiling and the<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
ladies and gentlemen with him were smiling, too.
When their gaze fell upon Nan they marched directly
toward her.</p>

<p>Nan got up. She looked all about for some
means of escape. Behind her, coming down the
aisle, were several other people headed by Professor
Krenner. And with them came the haughty girl,
Linda Riggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; cried Bess, starting up,
too.</p>

<p>Nan was speechless, and red with confusion.
Professor Krenner was smiling, as though he rather
enjoyed Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Harley!&rdquo; Linda Riggs cried to her
new acquaintance. &ldquo;They say that dear, brave girl
is in this car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she?&rdquo; asked Bess, feebly. &ldquo;Oh, Nan! what
do all these people want?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We want your friend, Miss Harley,&rdquo; Professor
Krenner said drily. &ldquo;I expect Linda did not know
that. Nancy Sherwood, does she call herself?
Well, Nancy Sherwood is a very brave girl, and we
have all come to tell her so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan!&rdquo; shrieked Bess, seeing a great light suddenly.
&ldquo;It was <i>you!</i> <i>You</i> are the heroine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She most certainly is the girl, Miss,&rdquo; the conductor
laughingly said. &ldquo;And she has been trying
to hide her light under a bushel, has she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess was stunned. The flushed countenance of<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
Linda Riggs was a study. Professor Krenner
seemed to be secretly enjoying the unpleasant girl&rsquo;s
amazement.</p>

<p>Linda seized Bess by the shoulder with a fierce
grip&mdash;a grip that made the girl from Tillbury wince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me you knew her?&rdquo; she
hissed in Bess&rsquo; ear as the passengers crowded about
the much troubled Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know I knew her,&rdquo; gasped Bess.
&ldquo;How should I know Nan Sherwood was the girl
who killed the rattlesnake?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care anything about that!&rdquo; cried the
enraged girl. &ldquo;You knew she was the one who
stole my bag&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stole your bag?&rdquo; repeated Bess, her own wrath
rising. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan Sherwood would not do such a thing. It
was all a mistake, Linda, and you know it. She
didn&rsquo;t have to steal your bag! She has one of her
own quite as good&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And where did she get it?&rdquo; sneered the railroad
magnate&rsquo;s daughter, her face deeply flushed and her
eyes fairly aflame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She bought it,&rdquo; declared Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;she&mdash;did!&rdquo; sneered Linda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did! she did! I was with her yesterday
when she bought it! So there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And who are <i>you?&rdquo;</i> responded the enraged girl.<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I should believe you any more
than that other one. You couldn&rsquo;t pay for your
lunch just now, and I had to pay for you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Bess, now quite in tears. &ldquo;I paid
you back&mdash;you horrid girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! did you?&rdquo; responded Linda, airily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I did! You know I did!&rdquo; Bess cried
stormily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. I never pay attention to such small
matters,&rdquo; and the other tossed her head.</p>

<p>Of course, all this was very foolish, and Bess
should not have paid Linda the compliment of attention.
But she did, and Linda saw that her words
stung&mdash;so she went on with her ill-natured tirade:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one matter that I <i>shall</i> pay attention
to,&rdquo; and she laughed, sneeringly. &ldquo;I shall see to it
that the girls of Lakeview Hall are informed of the
character of you and your friend. One of you
stealing my bag&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; gasped Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she was stopped before she got very far, I
grant you,&rdquo; laughed Linda, sarcastically. &ldquo;And the
other obliged to borrow forty-five cents to pay for
her luncheon in the dining car. It will amuse my
friends at the Hall, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan had heard none of this conversation between
her chum and Linda Riggs. Her own ears were
actually burning because of the complimentary
speeches the conductor and the passengers were making.<span class="pagenum">[48]</span>
Poor Nan was backed up against her chair,
blushing furiously and almost in tears of confusion,
while Bess was carrying on her wordy battle
with Linda, a few steps up the aisle.</p>

<p>But suddenly Nan, as well as those about her,
were quite startled by Bess Harley&rsquo;s shrill outburst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Linda Riggs!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You are the very
meanest girl I ever saw! If you say another mean
thing about Nan Sherwood I&rsquo;ll box your ears for
you!&rdquo; and the superheated Bess advanced upon her
antagonist, her hand raised, prepared to put her
threat into execution.</p>
<hr class="l1" />

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>LAKEVIEW HALL APPEARS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Well! I would have boxed her ears, I don&rsquo;t
care!&rdquo; Bess gasped, when Nan succeeded in pulling
her down into her chair. &ldquo;You ought to have heard
what she said about you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Nan answered and sighed.
&ldquo;And one good thing&mdash;it broke up that foolish
speech-making. I&rsquo;m so ashamed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of me!&rdquo; flared up Bess. &ldquo;I was only standing
up for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hereafter, dear, do your standing up, sitting
down,&rdquo; laughed Nan, hugging her still overwrought
chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; pouted the tearful Bess, &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
care!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight my own battles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you never fight!&rdquo; burst out Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that just as well?&rdquo; Nan observed, rather
gravely. &ldquo;Suppose your mother heard of your
wanting to box a girl&rsquo;s ears in a public place like
this car? And how Professor Krenner looked at
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care for him,&rdquo; muttered Bess.<span class="pagenum">[50]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you do. He will be one of our teachers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Riggs girl says that none of the girls at the
Hall think much of Professor Krenner,&rdquo; grumbled
Bess. &ldquo;They say he&rsquo;s cracked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t repeat what that Riggs girl says,&rdquo;
admonished Nan, with some sharpness. It exasperated
her for Bess to show that she had been influenced
at all by the rude rich girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve found out I don&rsquo;t like her,&rdquo; Bess
sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I discovered I didn&rsquo;t, before,&rdquo; Nan rejoined,
dryly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;ll tell awful stories about us at Lakeview
Hall,&rdquo; Bess said with a worried air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her tell,&rdquo; scoffed the more sensible Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;ell! We don&rsquo;t want to begin school with
all the girls against us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not be. Do you suppose that girl has
much influence with the nice, sensible girls who attend
Lakeview Hall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;ell!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess, again. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bess! I&rsquo;m astonished at you,&rdquo; declared Nan,
with some heat. &ldquo;Any one to hear you would think
you a money-worshipper. How can you bear to
be friends with me when my folks are poor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess began to laugh at her. &ldquo;Poor?&rdquo; she repeated.
&ldquo;And your dear mother just fallen heir to
fifty thousand dollars?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[51]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well&mdash;I forgot that,&rdquo; returned Nan, meekly.
&ldquo;But I know you loved me before we had any
prospect of having money, Bess. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s toady
to rich girls when we get to this school. Let&rsquo;s pick
our friends by some other standard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; agreed her chum. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had a lesson. That hateful thing! But if she does
tell stories about us to the other girls&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can disprove them by Professor Krenner,&rdquo;
added Nan. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like him,&rdquo; repeated Bess, pouting.</p>

<p>But Nan did. She was quite sure the instructor
with the big, shell-rimmed spectacles, understood
girls very well indeed, and that he would be a good
friend and a jolly companion if one would allow
him to be.</p>

<p>There was that about Professor Krenner that
reminded her of her own dear father. They were
both given to little, dry jokes; they were both big
men, with large, strong hands; and they were both
very observant.</p>

<p>How she would get along with the other instructors
at Lakeview Hall, and with Dr. Beulah Prescott,
herself, Nan did not know; but she felt that
she and Professor Krenner would always be good
friends.</p>

<p>Nor was she afraid of what Linda might say
about her at the Hall. Nan Sherwood was deeply
hurt by the girl&rsquo;s arrogance and unkindness; but<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
she had too large a fund of good sense to be disturbed,
as Bess was, over Linda&rsquo;s threatened scandal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a girl like her really has much
influence among other girls&mdash;not the right kind of
girls, at any rate,&rdquo; Nan thought. &ldquo;And Bess and I
don&rsquo;t want to get in with any other kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was just as eager as she could be, however,
to get to Lakeview Hall, and find out what it and
the girls were like. Boarding school was an unknown
world to Nan. She felt more confidence
now in herself, as the train bore her toward the
wild Huron shore on which the school stood, than
she had when she journeyed up into the Michigan
woods with her Uncle Henry, back in mid-winter.</p>

<p>In that past time she was leaving her dear parents
and they were leaving her. Each revolution of
the car wheels were widening the space between
&ldquo;Momsey&rdquo; and &ldquo;Papa Sherwood,&rdquo; and herself. By
this time Nan had grown used to their absence. She
missed them keenly&mdash;she would do that up to the
very moment that they again rejoined her; but the
pain of their absence was like that of an old wound.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she was determined, was Nan, to render
such a report of her school-life to her parents as
would make them proud of her.</p>

<p>Nan was not a particularly brilliant girl in her
books. She always stood well in her classes because
she was a conscientious and a faithful student.<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
Bess, really, was the quicker and cleverer of the two
in their studies.</p>

<p>Nan was very vigorous, and loved play much
more heartily than she did her books. Demerits
had not often come her way, however, either in
grammar school or high school. Mr. Mangel, the
Tillbury principal, had felt no hesitancy in vising
Nan&rsquo;s application blank for entrance to the same
grade as Bess Harley at Lakeview Hall. Nan, he
knew, would not disappoint Dr. Beulah Prescott.</p>

<p>This school that she was going to, Nan knew,
would be very different from the public school she
had attended heretofore. In the first place, it was
a girls&rsquo; world; there would be neither association
with, nor competition with, pupils of the other sex.</p>

<p>Nan was not wholly sure that she would like this
phase of her new school life. She liked boys and
had always associated with them.</p>

<p>Nan could climb, row, skate, swim, and cut her
initials in the bark of a tree without cutting her
fingers.</p>

<p>Her vigorous life in the woods during the past
six months had stored up within her a greater supply
of energy than she had ever before possessed.
She had, too, seen men and boys doing really big
things in the woods; she had seen courage displayed;
she had partaken of adventures herself that called
upon her reserves of character, as well as muscle.</p>

<p>Indeed, Nan was quite a different girl in some<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
respects from the timid, wondering child who had
gone away from Tillbury clinging to Uncle Henry&rsquo;s
hand. More than ever she felt the protecting instinct
stir within her when she saw her chum going
wrong. She knew she must assume the burden of
looking after Bess Harley in this new world they
were entering.</p>

<p>Two hundred girls to compete with! It looked to
be such a lot! Lakeview Hall was a very popular
institution, and although the building was not originally
intended for a school, it answered amply for
that purpose&mdash;as Professor Krenner told her. One
end of the great structure had never been completed;
for its builder&rsquo;s ideas had been greater than
his resources.</p>

<p>She knew that the castle-like structure standing
upon the bluff overlooking Freeling and the troubled
waters of Lake Huron, was much too vast for a
private dwelling, and that as a summer hotel it had
years before signally failed.</p>

<p>Under the executive care of Dr. Beulah Prescott
the place had expanded into a large and well-governed
school. Nan looked forward with both hope
and fear to meeting so many other girls all at the
same time.</p>

<p>The cost of tuition at Lakeview precluded the
presence of many pupils whose parents were not at
least moderately wealthy. In fact, it was a very
exclusive school, or &ldquo;select&rdquo; as Linda Riggs had<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
called it during her brief hour of friendship with
Bess Harley. Nan devoutly hoped that not many
of the other girls would be as &ldquo;select&rdquo; as Linda
Riggs.</p>

<p>Among the two hundred girls, surely not many
could be so purse-proud and arrogant as the railroad
magnate&rsquo;s daughter. Nan had not been long enough
removed from poverty to feel that she really was
rich, nor was it, after all, an enormous fortune.
Her mother&rsquo;s money was altogether too new an
acquisition to have made much of an impression
upon Nan&rsquo;s mind, save to stir her imagination.</p>

<p>She could, and did, imagine a sublimated &ldquo;dwelling
in amity&rdquo; on the little by-street in Tillbury.
She looked forward to the time when she and her
parents would be together in their old home; but
she could not imagine their style of living changed
to any degree.</p>

<p>The life before Nan in the boarding school, however,
she realized would be different from anything
she had ever experienced. Later, as dusk began to
shut down and the switch targets twinkled along
the right of way, she peered ahead eagerly for the
first sight of the school.</p>

<p>It appeared. Like an old, gray castle on the
Rhine, such as she and Bess had read about, the
sprawling, huge building was outlined against the
sky on which the glories of the sunset were reflected.
The little town in the valley was scarcely discernible<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
save for its twinkling evening lamps; but the Hall
stood out boldly on the headland&mdash;a silhouette cut
out of black cardboard, for not a single lamp shone
there.</p>

<small>THE BOY AT THE STATION</small></h2>


<p>Bess was in a great bustle as the train slowed
down for Freeling. She gathered all their possessions,
that nothing might be missed this time, and
then started for the door with only her shopping-bag
and raincoat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re forgetting something, Bess,&rdquo; cried Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; returned her chum, her eyes opening
very wide and very innocently. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be possible.
Suit-case, bag, coats, lunch box&mdash;I wish you would
throw <i>that</i> away, Nan! Sure, that&rsquo;s everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But you forget I&rsquo;m not a dray-horse,&rdquo;
Nan said drily. &ldquo;Come on and take your share of
the load for once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I forgot,&rdquo; murmured Bess, faintly, as Nan
proceeded to load her down.</p>

<p>They got out on the platform and the train
steamed away. Professor Krenner had disappeared.
They did not know that he had remained aboard the
train, which stopped at a flag-station a mile up the
track&mdash;a point nearer to his cabin than Freeling
proper.</p>

<p>There were a few bustling passengers in sight,<span class="pagenum">[58]</span>
but none of them were girls. Even Linda Riggs
had disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; asked Bess, helplessly. &ldquo;Not
a soul to meet us, Nan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you didn&rsquo;t expect all the girls would turn
out with a brass band to greet us, did you?&rdquo; chuckled
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely there must be some means of conveyance
to the Hall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shank&rsquo;s mare, maybe,&rdquo; returned her cheerful
chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can laugh!&rdquo; cried Bess, as though she considered
Nan&rsquo;s serenity a fault. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want
to climb away up that hill to-night in the dark, and
with this heavy old suit-case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite right. That would be too big a premium
placed upon education,&rdquo; laughed Nan. &ldquo;Let us
ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A man with a visored cap who was hurrying past
at this juncture, was halted and questioned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;B&rsquo;us for the Hall? Yes, Miss. Just the other
side of the station if it hasn&rsquo;t already gone,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! we&rsquo;ve lost it,&rdquo; complained Bess, starting
on a run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible! How could we lose it when we
never have had it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can be funny&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rounded the corner of the station just as a<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
pair of slowly-moving horses attached to a big,
lurching omnibus, were starting forward. The man
driving them leaned down from the seat, speaking
to somebody inside the &rsquo;bus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure there ain&rsquo;t no more of you to-night, Miss?&rdquo;
he asked. &ldquo;Dr. Prescott said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know there&rsquo;s no more of me, Charley,&rdquo; Miss
Linda Riggs&rsquo; voice interrupted tartly. &ldquo;And if you
don&rsquo;t hurry along you won&rsquo;t get your usual tip, I
can tell you <i>that!&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Bess, hanging back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s trying to run away with the school &rsquo;bus,&rdquo;
declared Nan, in some anger. &ldquo;Now, she sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
do that, Bess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her go,&rdquo; begged Bess. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to ride
with her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! I&rsquo;m not dying for her company, either,&rdquo;
Nan confessed. &ldquo;But I want to get up to that Hall
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The omnibus had completely turned around,
heading away from the station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hi, there!&rdquo; cried Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drive on, Charley,&rdquo; commanded Linda Riggs,
loudly.</p>

<p>The &rsquo;bus driver evidently did not hear Nan&rsquo;s call.
The latter dropped her bag and tossed her own coat
to Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to let him get away from us,&rdquo;
she cried.<span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>But Bess seized her arm. &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t! Let&rsquo;s not
have another quarrel with that Riggs girl right
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! I haven&rsquo;t quarreled with her at all,
yet,&rdquo; said Nan, somewhat amused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;so&mdash;mean,&rdquo; began Bess, when Nan interrupted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! we&rsquo;ll just beat her to it at that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, how, Nan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get there first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, <i>how?&rdquo;</i> asked her chum again.</p>

<p>Several automobiles were standing beside the
platform and Nan swiftly approached the driver of
the nearest one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know how to get to Lakeview Hall?&rdquo;
she asked of this person.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan saw that he was only a young boy; but he
wore gauntlets, had goggles attached to his cap, and
was evidently old enough to drive the car.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you take us up there?&rdquo; Nan asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;yes,&rdquo; again rather doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, Bess!&rdquo; called Nan, with satisfaction.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll beat that Linda Riggs after all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say!&rdquo; murmured the youthful automobile
driver.</p>

<p>But Nan paid little attention to him. Having
engaged him for the trip she hustled Bess and the<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>
baggage into his car without another word to him.
Finally she leaped in, too, and banged the door of
the tonneau.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! we&rsquo;re all ready,&rdquo; she said to the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;well&mdash;if you say so,&rdquo; he murmured, and
obediently cranked up and then stepped into the car
himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; whispered Nan to Bess. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an awfully
slow thing, isn&rsquo;t he? I don&rsquo;t see how he makes any
money tooling people around in this auto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s bothering <i>me</i>,&rdquo; whispered Bess, &ldquo;is how
we&rsquo;re going to pay him? I haven&rsquo;t but twenty cents
left. You know I bought candy on the train, beside
that lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not having wasted my money in riotous living,&rdquo;
laughed Nan, &ldquo;I can pay him all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The automobile whisked through the streets of
the lower town in a few moments. They passed the
lumbering &rsquo;bus with a scornful toot of the horn. In
the suburbs they went even faster, although they
were climbing the bluff all the time.</p>

<p>Lakeview Hall was alight now, and as they
approached it between the great granite posts at
the foot of the private driveway it looked more
friendly.</p>

<p>A honk of the automobile-horn in notification of
their approach, and immediately the cluster of incandescent
lights under the reflector on the great<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
front porch blazed into life. The wide entrance
to the Hall, and all the vicinity, was radiantly
illumined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; ejaculated Nan. &ldquo;I guess they do
meet us with a brass band!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For, with shouts of welcome, and a great flutter
of frocks and ribbons, a troop of girls ran out of
the Hall to welcome the newcomers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here she is, girls!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walter&rsquo;s the boy to do an errand right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t we the thoughtful bunch to send him
after you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, Linda! we&rsquo;re going to have the same old
room, Mrs. Cupp says.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The automobile came to a stop. The boy driver
drawled:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some mistake, girls. I didn&rsquo;t see Linda Riggs
at all. But here&rsquo;s a couple of new ones.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess had uttered a horrified gasp; but Nan was
almost convulsed with laughter. She could usually
appreciate the funny side of any situation; and to
her mind this most certainly was funny!</p>

<p>It was plain that Linda Riggs was popular enough
with some of her schoolmates to have them
welcome her with special clat. They had engaged
this boy with the automobile to meet her at
the station.</p>

<p>In place of Linda, arriving in the motor car,
Nan and Bess had usurped her place; while even<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
now the old &rsquo;bus was rumbling up the driveway
with Linda inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! who can they be?&rdquo; remarked one of
the girls, staring at Nan and Bess.</p>

<p>The former was quite composed as, with her own
and Bess Harley&rsquo;s possessions about her on the
lower of the four broad steps leading up to the
veranda, she drew out her purse to pay the boy for
the trip from the station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; she asked him, without observing
the surprised group in her rear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; stammered the
young chauffeur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes it is!&rdquo; exclaimed Nan. &ldquo;Of course you
have some regular charge&mdash;even if you were not
there at the station just to meet <i>us</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;o, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
to pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there <i>must</i> be!&rdquo; cried Nan, a little wildly.
&ldquo;Surely you run a public car?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. This is my father&rsquo;s car,&rdquo; admitted the boy,
whom Nan now saw was a very good looking boy
and very well dressed. &ldquo;I was just down there to
meet a friend&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I don&rsquo;t see how you missed her, Walter,&rdquo;
interrupted the girl behind Nan, and who had
spoken before. &ldquo;For here is Linda now, in
Charley&rsquo;s old &rsquo;bus.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh my!&rdquo; murmured Bess.<span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>Nan began to feel great confusion herself. It
was not so funny, after all!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why, then you do <i>not</i> have this car for
hire?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the boy, meekly. He was
looking at Nan Sherwood admiringly, for she made
a very pretty picture standing there in the strong
glow of the electric light. &ldquo;But I didn&rsquo;t mind bringing
you up&mdash;not at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are an awful chump, Walter,&rdquo; observed
the girl who had spoken before. &ldquo;Grace said you
could do an errand right; but it seems you&rsquo;re quite
as big a dunce as your sister.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grace is not a dunce, Cora Courtney!&rdquo; exclaimed
the boy, with some show of spirit, as he
started his car, not having shut off his engine.
&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he said to Nan, and was gone around
the curve of the drive as Charley brought his lazy
horses to a halt before the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am, girls!&rdquo; cried Linda Riggs, putting
her head out of the &rsquo;bus window. Then she saw
Nan and Bess standing on the steps of the portico,
and she demanded involuntarily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did those two girls get here ahead of me?&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THE RED-HAIRED GIRL</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Well! I must say it&rsquo;s a good joke on you,
Linda,&rdquo; said the tall girl, called Cora Courtney, in
response to Miss Riggs&rsquo; observation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; snapped the railroad magnate&rsquo;s
daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, they came up from the station in the
auto we girls sent after you. You know it&rsquo;s against
the rules for us to go down into the town so late,
so we couldn&rsquo;t send a delegation for you; but that
little Grace Mason said her brother would bring
you up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walter Mason!&rdquo; exclaimed Linda, hopping out
of the old &rsquo;bus. &ldquo;Is that who was driving that
car?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. That was Walter. And Walter is as big
a dunce as his sister,&rdquo; declared Cora, crossly. &ldquo;He
went right by you and brought up these two girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Linda&rsquo;s face was very much flushed. That she
had overreached herself in this matter, taught the
obstinate girl nothing. She had deliberately misinformed
the &rsquo;bus driver, when she told him there<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
were no other girls on the train, and had hurried
him away from the station.</p>

<p>So she had overlooked Walter Mason and his
car, and the boy had not seen her. Her scowl as
she looked upon the now calm Nan and the almost
petrified Bess, did not improve Linda&rsquo;s personal
appearance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I am not surprised at anything <i>those</i> two
do,&rdquo; scoffed the rich girl, loftily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; exclaimed Cora. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to
have done anything except to get a free ride.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed, that is just it!&rdquo; cried Linda, with a toss
of her head. &ldquo;Anything <i>free</i> is just what they are
looking for. One of them let me pay for her lunch
on the train. And the other&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The voice, very mellow and sweet (it reminded
Nan Sherwood of her mother&rsquo;s own in its soft
cadence) seemed to quell all harsher sounds instantly&mdash;the
sharp voice of Linda, even the querulous
notes of the katydids in the grove before the
Hall, and the strident tones of the crickets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan flashed a glance up the steps. There had
softly swept to the break of the short flight, a lovely
lady in trailing robes, gray bands of hair smoothed
over her ears, gray eyes as luminous as stars; and
only the soft lace at the low-cut neck of her gown<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
to divide its gray shade from the softly pink complexion
of Dr. Beulah Prescott.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s beautiful,&rdquo; breathed Nan in her chum&rsquo;s
ear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Girls!&rdquo; then said the preceptress of Lakeview
Hall again. &ldquo;The supper gong is sounding. Bring
the new arrivals in. They may have ten minutes
in the lavatory on this floor before appearing at
table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Linda? I hope you are quite
well. And these are two of our new girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan and Bess had picked up their possessions and
now mounted the steps hesitatingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come right here, my dears,&rdquo; said Dr. Prescott,
holding out a slim, beautifully white hand on
which there was no jewel. &ldquo;It must be that you are
the two friends from Tillbury, who were to arrive
by this train.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Nan said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are Nancy Sherwood?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And this other is Elizabeth Harley?&rdquo; pursued
Dr. Prescott, shaking hands with them both.</p>

<p>Bess began to breathe more freely. It was one
thing to face Linda Riggs down in the train; but
in the presence of all these girls who knew her
and did not know the newcomers&mdash;bold Elizabeth
found her pluck oozing rapidly away.<span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Prescott beckoned to one girl of the group,
and said: &ldquo;Play hostess in my stead, Laura, please.
This is Laura Polk, Nancy and Elizabeth. She
will show you where to freshen up a bit before supper,
and lead you to the dining hall, as well. Owing
to the delay of the workmen in making some
repairs, we are still in some confusion, but you will
be assigned to your rooms before supper is over.
I hope you will be very happy with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She patted Nan&rsquo;s shoulder, put her arm for a
moment around Bess, and then floated&mdash;rather than
walked&mdash;away. Nan had never seen anybody so
graceful of carriage as this lady. Even &ldquo;Momsey,&rdquo;
whom she worshipped, could not cross a room
as did the preceptress of Lakeview Hall.</p>

<p>The girl whom she had introduced to the two
friends, Laura Polk, was a smiling, freckled girl,
with a fiery thatch of hair. It was not bronze, or
red-gold, or any other fashionable color. It was
just plain, unmistakable red&mdash;nothing else.</p>

<p>She seemed to be a very pleasant girl. What
Linda Riggs had said about Nan and Bess in her
hearing made no impression on Laura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, lambkins,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wager you
feel all cinders and smutch after such a long ride
in the cars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We do,&rdquo; Nan agreed fervently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;W&rsquo;ay from Chicago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bess, finding her voice.<span class="pagenum">[69]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I came up myself day-before-yesterday,&rdquo; said
Laura. &ldquo;I know what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She led the way through the great entrance
hall and down a side passage to the tiled and enameled
lavatory. Even Bess was impressed by the
elegance of the furnishings. The rugs were handsome,
the carpets soft, thick pile, the hangings richly
decorative. Nan, of course, had never seen
anything like it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a delightful place,&rdquo; Bess said to her chum.
&ldquo;And such good taste in the decorating.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hope the supper will taste just as good,&rdquo; Nan
returned grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry in spite of the lunch
I ate. You spoiled your appetite with tea and
candy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t suppose there was anything left for
me in that old box when you got through,&rdquo; sniffed
Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes there was&mdash;and is,&rdquo; laughed Nan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
good, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, girls!&rdquo; broke in their red-headed guide.
&ldquo;Have you really part of your train lunch left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nan, shyly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it in that box?&rdquo; asked Laura Polk, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then hang onto it, do!&rdquo; begged Laura.</p>

<p>Nan and Bess looked at each other wonderingly,
and then both of them questioningly at Laura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll be glad of my advice&mdash;probably this<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>
very night. Dr. Beulah doesn&rsquo;t approve of us girls
eating between meals, and the girl that manages to
sneak a bite up to her room to eat at bedtime is
lucky, indeed,&rdquo; Laura declared, quite seriously. &ldquo;I
tell you, I have sometimes lain for hours in the
throes of starvation because I didn&rsquo;t have even a
cracker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; gasped Bess. &ldquo;I should think you
would take up something from the supper table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! ha!&rdquo; laughed Laura, hollowly. &ldquo;Wait till
you have seen the supper table.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; queried Nan, curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see all this luxury about you,&rdquo; proclaimed
the red-haired girl, solemnly. &ldquo;You beheld the
magnificence of the main hall as you came in. And
it extends to Dr. Beulah&rsquo;s apartments, which are
downstairs here, on the right of the main door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But when you turn the other way,&rdquo; continued
Laura, &ldquo;and approach the chaste and nunnery-like
rooms devoted to the uses of &lsquo;us young ladies,&rsquo; as
Mrs. Cupp calls us, you will at once and immediately
be struck, stroke, and stricken with the vast
and monstrous difference between our part of the
castle and Dr. Beulah&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried this extravagantly speaking girl,
&ldquo;Dr. Beulah has her course dinner at night, carried
in by black Susan on a mighty tray. I have
often thought that it would be a great lark to catch
Susan in the back hall, blindfold her, threaten her<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
with the boathouse ghost if she squealed, and bear
off the doctor&rsquo;s dinner as the spoils of the campaign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But goodness me!&rdquo; cried Nan, when she could
speak for laughter. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t they really give you
enough supper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait! Only wait!&rdquo; repeated Laura, warmly.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon see. Dr. Beulah believes most thoroughly
in &lsquo;the simple life&rsquo;&mdash;for us girls. Oh, she
do&mdash;believe me! And I think Mrs. Cupp even
counts the crackers that go on each dish that is set
on the table at supper time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes we have crackers and milk for supper,&rdquo;
added Laura, dropping her voice to the tone
of one telling a ghost story at midnight. Then in
a still more ghost-like voice she repeated: &ldquo;Sometimes
we have crackers and milk. The lacteal fluid
is usually twice skimmed, first for the teachers&rsquo;
table (they have cream in their coffee in the morning),
secondly for the thin, anmic fluid we get on
our oatmeal. But, anyhow, it is milk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are never more than seven crackers on a
plate&mdash;just seven, the perfect number,&rdquo; sighed this
hyperbolical girl. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve counted them again and
again. Why seven, and not six, or eight, deponent
knoweth not. I think Mrs. Cupp counts them out
that way for some fell purpose of her own,&rdquo; went
on Laura, reflectively. &ldquo;She must have the crackers
all numbered and she deals &rsquo;em around as in a game<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
at cards. Anyhow, I tried a trick once and it didn&rsquo;t
work, so I believe she has them numbered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; asked wide-eyed Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The girl next to me didn&rsquo;t appear at supper. I
took her crackers and slipped them down my stocking.
But Mrs. Cupp caught me before I got out
of the room, took me to her den, and made me
disgorge the booty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A mellow gong clanged through the building.
Nan and Bess, who were now almost convulsed by
their new friend&rsquo;s remarks, had managed to make
some sort of a toilet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; whispered the red-haired girl,
hoarsely. &ldquo;Never mind your bags and wraps. <i>They</i>
will be perfectly safe on that settee. But hang onto
the lunch box. If Mrs. Cupp finds <i>that</i> she will
confiscate its contents, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She thrust the box into Bess&rsquo; hands and drove
both the new girls before her, like a fussy hen with
two chickens.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[73]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>A FAMOUS INTRODUCTION</small></h2>


<p>The girls crowded into the dining hall from all
directions. Nan and Bess were told that there were
many who had not yet arrived; but to the two
strangers from Tillbury it seemed as though there
was a great throng.</p>

<p>The curious glances flung at Nan and her chum
confused them, the buzz of conversation added to
their embarrassment, and had it not been for the
red-haired girl, Laura Polk, they would have been
tempted to turn and flee. They were quickly shown
to seats, however, at a table where every seat was
filled with laughing, chattering girls. As the school
was not yet fully organized for work, there was no
person in authority to take the head of the table.
Nan and Bess were glad to note that their acquaintance,
the red-haired girl, was with them. Bess
was under the embarrassing necessity of holding the
lunch box in her lap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Laura!&rdquo; whispered one mischievous girl
from across the table. &ldquo;I thought you were going
to have your hair dyed this vacation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; declared Miss Polk gravely.<span class="pagenum">[74]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! I must say it didn&rsquo;t seem to do it any
good,&rdquo; was the next observation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said the serious, red-haired
girl. &ldquo;The dye didn&rsquo;t take.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really do wonder, Laura,&rdquo; said another of her
schoolmates, &ldquo;how your hair ever came to be such
a very reddish red.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had scarlet fever when I was very young,&rdquo;
said Miss Polk, promptly, &ldquo;and it settled in my
hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The smothered laughter over this had scarcely
subsided when another girl asked: &ldquo;Say, Polk!
what&rsquo;s your new chum, there, got in her lap?&rdquo;</p>

<p>This pointed question was aimed at Bess, who
blushed furiously. Laura remained as grave as a
judge, and explained:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s her lunch. She seems to be afraid
she won&rsquo;t get supper enough here and has brought
reinforcements.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laughter that went up at this sally drew the
attention of many sitting near to that table. Bess
Harley&rsquo;s eyes filled with angry tears. She saw
that the red-haired girl had set a trap for her, and
she had walked right into it.</p>

<p>Bess really had feared she would not have supper
enough. Having refused to eat out of the lunch
box on the train, her appetite had now begun unmistakably
to manifest itself. If the usual supper
served the pupils of Lakeview Hall was as scanty<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>
as Laura Polk had intimated, the remains of the
lunch Bess&rsquo; mother had bought for the two chums
in Chicago would be very welcome indeed.</p>

<p>A glance around the table, however, soon assured
even unobservant Bess that the red-haired
girl was letting her tongue run idly when she
criticised the food served. There were heaps of
bread and biscuit, plenty of golden butter, and a
pitcher of milk that had <i>not</i> been twice skimmed,
beside each plate. Besides, there were apple sauce
and sliced peaches and cold meat in abundance.
The supper was plain, but plentiful enough, considering
that Dr. Prescott believed in giving her girls
their hearty meal at noon.</p>

<p>Nan had at once suspected that Laura Polk was
joking. But, even she had not appreciated the fact
that the red-haired girl was deliberately laying a
trap for them until the subject of the lunch box was
brought up. Nan whispered quickly to Bess:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Laugh! laugh! Laugh with them, instead of
letting them laugh at you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Bess could not do that. She was very angry.
And as soon as these fun-loving girls saw she had
lost her temper, they kept the joke up.</p>

<p>Bess angrily allowed the lunch box to fall to the
floor under the table. But, as the meal progressed,
gradually almost every dish on the table gravitated
toward Bess&rsquo; plate.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want any more of your apple sauce, Cora?&rdquo; the<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
question would be raised, quite gravely. &ldquo;No?
Well do pass it this way, we&rsquo;re hungry over here,&rdquo;
and the half-eaten apple sauce would appear at
Bess Harley&rsquo;s elbow.</p>

<p>Her plate was soon ringed about with pitchers of
milk, half-empty butter plates, broken biscuits, dabs
of peaches and apple sauce in lonely-looking saucers.
Nan was almost choked with a desire to laugh; and
yet she was sorry for her chum, too. If Bess had
only been able to take the joke in good part!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t show that you are so disturbed by their
fun,&rdquo; begged Nan of her friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fun! I&rsquo;ll write my mother and have her take
me away from here,&rdquo; muttered Bess, in a rage.
&ldquo;Why, these girls are all <i>beasts!&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, honey! don&rsquo;t make it worse than it already
is,&rdquo; advised sensible Nan. &ldquo;The madder you
get the more they will enjoy teasing you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A rather severe and plainly dressed woman,
wearing spectacles, who had been walking about
among the tables, now came to the one where Nan
and Bess were seated. She looked somewhat suspiciously
at the dishes pushed so close to Bess Harley&rsquo;s
plate; but all the girls at the table were as
sober as they could be.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dr. Prescott tells me you are the two girls
from Tillbury,&rdquo; she said to Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;My friend is Bess Harley
and I am Nan Sherwood.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[77]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We are glad to have you with us, and you have
been assigned to Number Seven, Corridor Four.
Your trunks will be unpacked in the trunk room in
the basement to-morrow.&rdquo; Then she flashed another
glance at the array of dishes before Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is the meaning of this?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; Bess stammered, and some of the
girls gave suppressed giggles.</p>

<p>Laura Polk soberly came to her rescue&mdash;or appeared
to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is her birthday, and all the girls have been
giving her presents. At least, that is the way I
understand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Irrepressible laughter broke out around the
table. Even Mrs. Cupp smiled grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I fancy you started the birthday presentation,
Laura,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let us have no more of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When she had passed along Laura Polk leaned
forward to whisper shrilly across Nan to Bess:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a care, Bess! I think Mrs. Cupp suspects
you. Don&rsquo;t try to smuggle any of that apple sauce
up to Room Seven, Corridor Four, in your stocking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course this was all very ridiculous, and, taken
in the right spirit, the introduction of Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s
chum to Lakeview Hall, would not have
been so bad. This was really a mild initiation to the
fraternal companionship of a lot of gay, fun-loving
girls.<span class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>

<p>But Bess had a high sense of her own dignity.
At home, in Tillbury, because her father was an
influential man, and her family of some local importance,
nobody had ever treated her in this way.
To be an object of the ridicule of strangers is a hard
trial at best. Just then, to Bess&rsquo; mind, it seemed
as though her whole school life at Lakeview Hall
must be spoiled by this opening incident.</p>

<p>Nan felt for her friend, for she well knew how
sensitive Bess was. But she knew this was all in
fun. She could not help but be amused by the
red-haired girl&rsquo;s jokes. There wasn&rsquo;t a scrap of
harm in anything the exuberant one did or said.
There was no meanness in Laura Polk. She was
not like Linda Riggs.</p>

<p>Had it not been for Nan, Bess would never
have found her way to Room Seven, Corridor Four,
she was so blinded with angry tears. The room
they were to occupy together was up two flights of
broad stairs, and had a wide window overlooking
the lake. Nan knew this to be the fact at once, for
she went to the open window, heard the soughing
of the uneasy waves on the pebbly beach far below,
and saw the red, winking eye of the lighthouse at
the mouth of Freeling Inlet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a lovely room, Bess,&rdquo; she declared, as she
snapped on the electric light.</p>

<p>Bess banged the door viciously. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care
how nice it is! I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t stay here!&rdquo; she cried.<span class="pagenum">[79]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, pshaw, Bess! you don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; returned
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do&mdash;so now! I won&rsquo;t remain to be insulted
by these girls! My mother won&rsquo;t want me to.
I shall write her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <i>wouldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</i> cried Nan, in horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why wouldn&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you would trouble and
worry your mother about such a thing, just as soon
as you get here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;ell!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do that for anything,&rdquo; Nan urged.
&ldquo;And, besides, I don&rsquo;t think the girls meant any
real harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That homely, red-headed Polk girl is just as
mean as she can be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she has to take jokes herself about her
red hair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care!&rdquo; grumbled Bess. &ldquo;She has no
right to play such mean tricks on <i>me</i>. Why did she
tell me to take that horrid old lunch box in to supper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because she foresaw just what would happen,&rdquo;
chuckled Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you can laugh!&rdquo; cried Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should not have been so gullible,&rdquo; Nan declared.
&ldquo;That was a perfectly ridiculous story
Laura told us about the food being so poor and
scanty, and we should not have believed it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[80]</span></p>

<p>Bess was staring at her with angry sparks in her
eyes. She suddenly burst out with:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That old lunch box! If it hadn&rsquo;t been for you,
Nan Sherwood, we would not have brought it here
with us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&mdash;Is that quite right, Bess?&rdquo; gently
suggested Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is!&rdquo; snapped her chum. &ldquo;If you had
taken my advice you would have flung it out of the
window and eaten in the dining car in a proper
manner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were a good many retorts Nan might have
made. She wanted to laugh, too. It did seem so
ridiculous for Bess to carry on so over a silly
joke. She was making a mountain out of a molehill.</p>

<p>But it would be worse than useless to argue the
point, and to laugh would surely make her chum
more bitter&mdash;perhaps open a real breach between
them that not even time could heal.</p>

<p>So Nan, in her own inimitable, loving way, put
both arms suddenly about Bess and kissed her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
awfully sorry, dear; forgive me,&rdquo; she said, just as
though the fault was all hers.</p>

<p>Bess broke down and wet Nan&rsquo;s shoulder with
her angry tears. But they were a relief. She
sobbed out at last:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;ll never, <i>never</i> see a shoe-box lunch
again! I just do&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>To interrupt her came a solemn summons on the
door of Number Seven&mdash;<i>rap, rap, rap!</i> The two
newcomers to Lakeview Hall looked at each other,
startled.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[82]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small><a name="THE_PROCESSION_OF_THE_SAWNEYS" id="THE_PROCESSION_OF_THE_SAWNEYS"></a>THE PROCESSION OF THE SAWNEYS</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;Goodness! what can that be?&rdquo; demanded Nan.</p>

<p>Rap! rap! rap! the knock was repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you lock that door, Bess?&rdquo; exclaimed Nan.</p>

<p>Before her chum could answer, the knob was
turned and the door swung slowly open. Several
figures crowded about the opening portal. It was
no summons by one of the teachers, as Nan and
Bess had expected. The first figure that appeared
clearly to the startled vision of the two chums was
rather appalling.</p>

<p>It was a tall girl with a pillow case drawn over
her head and shoulders. Her arms were thrust
through two holes in the sides and she could see
through two smaller holes burned in the pillow
case. She leaned on a broom, the brush part of
which was also covered with white muslin. Upon
this background was drawn a horned owl in charcoal.</p>

<p>This horned owl was no more solemn than were
the girls themselves who came filing in behind their
leader. They came in two by two and circled<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
around the work table which was set across the
room at the foot of the two beds. The second
couple bore a big tea-tray and on that tray reposed&mdash;<i>the
forgotten lunch box Bess had dropped under
the supper table!</i></p>

<p>Poor Bess uttered a horrified gasp; Nan came
near disgracing herself in her chum&rsquo;s eyes forever,
by exploding into laughter. There was a faint giggle
from some hysterical girl down the line and the
leader rapped smartly upon the floor with the handle
of the decorated broom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies!&rdquo; ejaculated the leader, her voice somewhat
muffled behind the pillowslip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Votes for women!&rdquo; was the faint response from
somewhere in the line.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence in the ranks!&rdquo; exclaimed Laura Polk,
snatching the tin tray away from her partner and
banging on it with her fist. The lunch box, decorated
with a soiled bow of violet ribbon, had been
placed on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies!&rdquo; repeated the girl behind the mask.
&ldquo;We have with us to-night, in our very midst, as
it were, two sawneys who should be <a href="#front">initiated into
all the rites and mysteries of Lakeview Hall</a>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear! hear!&rdquo; sepulchrally came from the red-haired
girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better keep still, too, Laura,&rdquo; admonished
another girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! very well!&rdquo; answered Laura.<span class="pagenum">[84]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;These sawneys must be taught their place,&rdquo;
pursued the leader of the gay company.</p>

<p>The term &ldquo;sawney&rdquo; in the lumber camps and
upon the Great Lakes, means tyro, or novice. These
girls had picked up the phrase from their brothers,
without doubt. Bess thought it a particularly objectionable
name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; said the girl in the pillowslip, &ldquo;they
must join our procession and march as shall be
directed. Fall in, sawneys, behind the first two
guards. Refuse at your peril!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s mind was already made up. This was
only fun&mdash;it was a great game of ridicule. To refuse
to join in the sport would mark her and Bess
for further, and future, punishment.</p>

<p>Before her chum could object, Nan seized her
and ran her right into line ahead of the red-haired
girl and her companion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready! March!&rdquo; commanded the masked girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; objected Laura Polk. &ldquo;These two
sawneys ought to be made to eat their lunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess fairly snorted, she was so angry. But Nan
would not let her pull away. She cried, before her
chum could say anything:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! we promise to eat it all before we go to
bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; declared the leader. &ldquo;Be still,
Polk. March!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Against her will at first, then because she did not<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
know what else to do, Bess Harley went along
beside her chum. &ldquo;The Procession of the Sawneys&rdquo;&mdash;quite
a famous institution, by the way, at Lakeview
Hall&mdash;was begun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the next innocent?&rdquo; demanded one girl,
hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Number Eighteen, on this corridor,&rdquo; was the
reply. &ldquo;That girl from Wauhegan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wau&mdash;what-again?&rdquo; sputtered Laura Polk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, there, Polk!&rdquo; admonished the masked
leader. &ldquo;Never mind your bad puns. Here we are.
Attention!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The procession halted. The leader banged the
door three times as she had at Number Seven, with
the handle of the broom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come in! don&rsquo;t stop to knock,&rdquo; called somebody
inside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! that&rsquo;s the way to treat us,&rdquo; grunted
Laura, as the door swung inward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; the girls all became silent.</p>

<p>There was a light in the room and a tall, thin
girl, with rather homely features but a beautiful
set of teeth, scrambled up from the floor where she
had been sitting cross-legged, arranging her lower
bureau drawer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gracious&mdash;goodness&mdash;Agnes!&rdquo; she gasped, when
she saw the head of the procession.</p>

<p>Then silence fell again&mdash;that is, human voices
ceased. But the visiting girls marked instantly the<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
peculiar fact that the room sounded like a clock-shop,
with all the clocks going.</p>

<p>There was an alarm clock hung by a ribbon
right beside the head of one of the two beds in the
room. A little ormolu clock was ticking busily on
the bureau, and an easel clock stood upon the
work table. In the corner hung an old-fashioned
cuckoo clock in one of the elaborately carved cases
made in the Black Forest, and just at this moment
the door at the top flew open and the Cuckoo jerked
her head out and announced the time&mdash;nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>This was too much for the risibility of the girls
crowding in at the door, and no pounding of the
broom handle could entirely quell the giggles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s wearing a watch!&rdquo; gasped one girl.
&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another hanging on the side of the
mirror.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, girls!&rdquo; burst out Laura Polk. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
certainly caught Miss Procrastination herself. You
know, &lsquo;procrastination is the thief of time,&rsquo; and this
Wau&mdash;what-again girl must have stolen all these
timepieces.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t either!&rdquo; declared the occupant of the
room. &ldquo;Pop and I took &rsquo;em for a debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; commanded the girl in the pillow case.
&ldquo;What is your name, sawney?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amelia Boggs,&rdquo; was the prompt reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amelia, you must come with us,&rdquo; commanded
the leader of the sawney procession.<span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I haven&rsquo;t time,&rdquo; objected the victim.</p>

<p>There was another outburst of laughter at this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let her take her time with her,&rdquo; Laura declared;
and they proceeded to hang the alarm clock around
Miss Boggs&rsquo; neck, the ormolu on one arm and the
table clock on the other. Both watches were pinned
prominently on her chest, and thus adorned, the girl
from Wauhegan was added to the procession.</p>

<p>It had certainly become a merry one by this time.
Even Bess discovered that this sort of fun was all
a good-natured play. She could not laugh at others
and remain sullen herself; so her sky gradually
cleared.</p>

<p>At the next door behind which a &ldquo;sawney&rdquo; lurked,
instead of knocking, the leader set off the alarm-clock.
It was a sturdy, loud-voiced alarm, and it
buzzed and rattled vigorously.</p>

<p>The two girls inside, both the new one and the
sophomore whose room she was to share, rushed to
the door at this terrible din. This initiate was a
little, fluffy, flaxen-haired, pink and white girl, of
a very timid disposition. She had been put to room
with Grace Mason, of whom Nan and Bess had
heard before.</p>

<p>Nan was particularly interested in Grace, who
seemed to be of a very retiring disposition, and was
very pretty. But her new room-mate was even
more timid. She at once burst into tears when
she saw the crowd of strange girls, having been<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
told that the girls of Lakeview Hall hazed all
strangers unmercifully.</p>

<p>The visiting party tied a pillow case on the flaxen-haired
girl for a bib, and made her carry a towel
in each hand for handkerchiefs. One girl carried
a pail and bath sponge, and the procession halted at
frequent intervals while imaginary pools of tears
were sponged up from the floor before the victim&rsquo;s
feet.</p>

<p>The procession might have continued indefinitely
had not Mrs. Cupp appeared at ten o&rsquo;clock and put
a stop to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re over time, young ladies, half an hour,&rdquo;
she said in her abrupt way. &ldquo;A bad example to the
new pupils, and to your juniors. Postpone any
more of this till to-morrow night. To your rooms!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They scattered to their rooms. Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s word
was law. She was Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s first assistant, and
had the interior management of the school in her
very capable hands. There was nothing very motherly
or comforting about Mrs. Cupp. But Nan decided
that Mrs. Cupp was not really wholly unsympathetic
after all.</p>

<p>Nan and Bess hurried back to Number Seven,
Corridor Four. All Bess&rsquo; anger and tears had evaporated,
and she was full of talk and laughter. Moreover,
she and Nan ate every crumb of the shoe-box
lunch before they went to bed!</p>

<small>EVERYTHING NEW</small></h2>


<p>Lessons were not taken up for several days after
Nan Sherwood and Bess Harley arrived at Lakeview
Hall. This gave them an opportunity for
getting acquainted with the other girls and their
strange surroundings, as well as the routine of the
school.</p>

<p>At this time of the year the rising bell was at
six and breakfast at seven. The girls could either
spend the hour before breakfast in study or out-of-door
recreation. The grounds connected with the
Hall comprised all the plateau at the top of the
bluff, with a mile of shore at its foot. At one place
a roughly built, crooked flight of steps all the way
down the face of the bluff, offered a path to the
boathouse. By day that sprawling stone building
was merely a place to shelter the school&rsquo;s many
boats, and a boatkeeper was on hand to attend to
the girls&rsquo; needs. But at night, so it was whispered,
the boathouse had a ghostly occupant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Nan Sherwood, with
laughter, when she was told this. &ldquo;What kind of a
ghost?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[90]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A black ghost&mdash;all black,&rdquo; declared May Winslow,
who seemed to be of a rather superstitious
nature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean the ghost of a colored man?&rdquo; demanded
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! nobody ever saw his face. But he&rsquo;s all in
black,&rdquo; Miss Winslow stated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! that&rsquo;s a novelty, at least,&rdquo; chuckled Nan.
&ldquo;Usually ghosts are sheeted in white, with phosphorescent
eyes and clammy hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; gasped May. &ldquo;Nobody ever got
near enough to him to let him touch her! I should
say not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And why should he haunt that boathouse?&rdquo; was
Nan&rsquo;s further demand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! we don&rsquo;t know that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever been a murder committed there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! how you talk! A murder at Lakeview
Hall? The idea!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the ghosts I ever heard of were supposed to
be the disembodied spirits either of persons who met
with some catastrophe, or who committed a capital
crime. They usually haunt the spot where the
tragedy occurred. Now, my dear, what did this
poor, black ghost do in life that he has to haunt that
boathouse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can laugh!&rdquo; exclaimed May, rather offended.
&ldquo;But if you ever see the ghost you won&rsquo;t
be so light-minded about it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>And, oddly enough, May Winslow was a true
prophet in this case; but Nan Sherwood, at the time,
only laughed.</p>

<p>She and Bess, on the morning following their
arrival at the school, went down to the trunk room
to get their possessions. Mrs. Cupp abrogated to
herself the right of search for, and seizure of, all
contraband goods brought to the school by the pupils.
The trunks must be unpacked under her eye&mdash;and
a watchful eye it was!</p>

<p>Many a foolish or unwise mother allowed her
daughter to wear garments or articles of adornment
that Mrs. Cupp did not approve. And, as has
before been said, at Lakeview Hall Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s will
was law.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Annie, I told you last year that those
low-cut garments were not fit for winter wear in
this climate. You should have told your aunt that
I disapproved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>did</i>,&rdquo; snapped the black-eyed girl who was
thus addressed. &ldquo;But auntie says she has worn
them all her life, and there is no reason why I should
not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes there is. I am the reason,&rdquo; returned
Mrs. Cupp, grimly. &ldquo;Leave those things in your
trunk, or return them. And tell your aunt that if
she does not send you suitable and warm under-garments
for the winter, that I will buy them and
the cost will appear upon your quarterly bill.<span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Lettie Roberts! you know very well that
no girl can wear a heel on her shoes like that in this
school. What would Miss Gleason say?&rdquo; Miss
Gleason was the physical instructor. &ldquo;If you wish
to retain those shoes I will have the heels lowered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mercy me, Mrs. Cupp!&rdquo; remonstrated the
victim this time. &ldquo;Those are my brand new dancing
pumps!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not dance in these pumps here,&rdquo; responded
the matron, firmly. &ldquo;Make up your mind
quickly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heel &rsquo;em!&rdquo; shot in Lettie, who knew of old that
Mrs. Cupp was adamant. &ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use trying to balk Mrs. Cupp,&rdquo; Laura Polk
had warned Nan and Bess. &ldquo;It would be just as
wise to butt your heads against a brick wall to make
an impression on the wall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cupp had a sharp eye for anything the girls
desired to take out of their trunks. And that which
went back into the trunks remained in her care, for
she insisted upon keeping the trunk keys as well as
the key of the trunk-room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this you have buried at the bottom of
your trunk, Nancy?&rdquo; she asked Nan, sharply, when
she came to a long, narrow box, made very neatly
of cabinet wood by the skilful fingers of Tom Sherwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy, Nan!&rdquo; whispered Bess, peering over her<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
chum&rsquo;s shoulder, &ldquo;it looks horribly like a baby&rsquo;s
coffin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather you didn&rsquo;t take that out, Mrs.
Cupp,&rdquo; said Nan, hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; repeated the lady, eyeing Nan suspiciously
through her glasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am! please don&rsquo;t take it out,&rdquo; fluttered
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wish to let it remain in my care, then, do
you?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Cupp, drily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; Nan murmured.</p>

<p>Bess&rsquo; eyes were big with wonder. Her chum had
a secret that was not known to her!</p>

<p>Some of the other girls were listeners, too. Linda
Riggs was impatiently awaiting her turn to have
Mrs. Cupp examine the contents of her trunk. She
tossed her head and said, in scarcely a muffled tone,
to Cora Courtney:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That Sherwood girl has probably succeeded in
taking something and hiding it in her trunk. I
told you, Cora, how she came so near getting away
with my new bag when I was not looking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, her bag is just like yours, Linda,&rdquo; said
Cora.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! They&rsquo;re not alike, at all,&rdquo; cried the
ill-natured Linda. &ldquo;She couldn&rsquo;t afford to own such
a bag honestly. Mine cost nearly forty dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, maybe the Sherwood girl has more money<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
than we think,&rdquo; whispered Cora. &ldquo;I saw her give
Mrs. Cupp some bank notes to take care of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stolen!&rdquo; exclaimed Linda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she has them, at least,&rdquo; said Cora, who
was poor herself but loved money, and was always
making friends with richer girls that she might
share in their spending money. &ldquo;You know, we
want to have some bang-up banquets this fall, and
parties and the like. Somebody&rsquo;s got to furnish the
&lsquo;sinews of war&rsquo;&mdash;and you can&rsquo;t do it all, Linda. Better
make friends with Sherwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind!&rdquo; cried Linda.</p>

<p>But Cora was a crafty girl. She herself said
nothing and did nothing to offend Nan or Bess. It
became common report, however, that Nan Sherwood
had something in her trunk of which she
would rather go without the use than show to Mrs.
Cupp. And, of course, that aroused general curiosity.</p>

<p>Bess, on her part, felt not a little hurt. She was
sure there was nothing she would not tell or show
Nan. She did not speak of the matter to her chum,
for Nan pointedly avoided it. But it troubled Bess,
when the other girls tried to pump her about the
box in Nan&rsquo;s trunk, that she was unable to look
knowing and refuse to tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about it,&rdquo; she snapped.
&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t tell me her secrets.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; cried Laura. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of being<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
chums with a girl who locks up the innermost recesses
of her heart against you&mdash;and her trunk, as
well? Why! I and my chum even borrow each
other&rsquo;s chewing gum!&rdquo; she added with her usual
exaggeration.</p>

<p>Nan, however, would not be offended at anything
Bess said, and was so helpful and kind that her
chum could not long retain even a shadow of unfriendliness.
During the first days of school the
two friends from Tillbury gathered a number of
girls about them; some novices like themselves; others,
girls of about their own age who had spent
from one to three terms at the Hall previous to this
fall semester.</p>

<p>Laura Polk, the red-haired joker, was on the same
corridor as Nan and Bess, so naturally they saw
a good deal of her. And she was always good
fun.</p>

<p>Grace Mason and her room-mate, flaxen-haired
Lillie Nevin, were two more who soon took shelter
under Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s wing. The more boisterous
girls harassed Grace and Lillie at times, and yet they
courted them, too, for Grace&rsquo;s parents and brother
lived on the outskirts of Freeling and she could
communicate through Walter much more easily
with the outside world than could many of her
schoolmates.</p>

<p>Then there was &ldquo;Procrastination Boggs,&rdquo; as the
queer girl from Wauhegan had been nicknamed.<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>
She joined forces with the girls of Number Seven,
Corridor Four, right at the start.</p>

<p>Nan and Bess, in fact, found themselves in a very
busy world indeed. Lessons, study, gymnasium
work, boating, walking, tennis, basket-ball, and a
dozen other activities, occupied their days. And
sometimes at night,&mdash;even after the solemn tolling
of the half-past nine curfew,&mdash;slippered feet ran
about the dim corridors with as little noise as the
mice made behind the wainscoting. Bands of whispering,
giggling girls gathered in the various rooms
and told stories, played games, held bare-foot dances,
and ate goodies, when they were supposed to be
deeply engaged in the preparation of the morrow&rsquo;s
work, or long after they should have retired.</p>

<p>Nan was careful to break no important rules, nor
did she allow careless Bess to fall into the company
of girls who broke them. Of innocent amusement
there was plenty at Lakeview Hall.</p>

<p>Both chums were fond of boating and other
aquatic sports. Lake Huron, of course, was entirely
different from the millpond at home; but they
knew how to row and paddle, and there were plenty
of boats and canoes to use here, for the asking.</p>

<p>And it was because of their delight in paddling a
canoe that Nan Sherwood and Bess Harley first
fell into a real adventure at Lakeview Hall.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[97]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>A SEPTEMBER SQUALL</small></h2>


<p>It was a still, hazy September afternoon, so warm
that the frost that had helped to open the chestnut
burrs that very morning seemed to have been
an hallucination. The lake was as calm as a millpond;
but Lake Huron is notoriously treacherous.</p>

<p>Henry, the boatkeeper at Lakeview Hall, was not
as weatherwise as he should have been. He had
allowed a number of boats to be taken out that afternoon
without warning the girls to beware of squalls.</p>

<p>Not that such warning would have been taken
seriously by many of the girls, for a fairer day in
the seeming had not appeared on the calendar. Nan
and Bess decided to go out in one of the double
canoes.</p>

<p>The chums from Tillbury did not own a boat.
Several of the older girls did, and Bess had already
written home for a motor boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tease dad for a motor boat first,&rdquo; she confided
to Nan. &ldquo;Of course he won&rsquo;t hear to <i>that</i>.
So I&rsquo;ll try to get a sailboat&mdash;what do they call &rsquo;em?&mdash;a
<i>cat</i>, with an auxiliary engine. And he won&rsquo;t
listen to that, either.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[98]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why ask for something you know you can&rsquo;t
have?&rdquo; asked the wondering Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; exclaimed Bess, exasperated
at such lack of understanding. &ldquo;Why, if I
ask for something big, dad will compromise in the
end, and probably give me just what I originally
expected to have. &lsquo;Aim high&rsquo; is my motto. Oh,
we&rsquo;ll get a nice canoe, at the least, or a cedar boat
with a portable engine and propeller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This way of getting what one wished rather
shocked Nan, who always asked pointblank for
what she wanted, but was usually wise enough not
to think too much about what she knew she could
not have.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an awfully roundabout way of getting
what you desire,&rdquo; she suggested to Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you don&rsquo;t know my father. Mother has
to do the same. He has plenty of money, but sometimes
he hates to give it up. I can tease almost
anything out of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush, Bess! Suppose anybody else should hear
you?&rdquo; Nan suggested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said careless Bess. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
that Linda Riggs going down with Gracie Mason
to the dock. I bet Walter is coming in his <i>Bargain
Rush</i> for Grace, and Linda will get invited. I&rsquo;d just
love to have a motor boat, Nan, just to get ahead
of Linda. She can&rsquo;t have one, I heard Cora say,
because her father is afraid of them.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[99]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;None of the girls own motor boats,&rdquo; Nan said,
calmly. &ldquo;The canoe is all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were in the canoe and had put up the little
leg-o&rsquo;-mutton sail, before Walter Mason&rsquo;s <i>Bargain
Rush</i> came out around Lighthouse Point, from the
inlet, and chugged over to the school dock where
Walter&rsquo;s sister was waiting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walter is just devoted to Grace,&rdquo; Nan said. &ldquo;I
think he is a dreadfully nice boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better keep your opinion to yourself,&rdquo; laughed
Bess. &ldquo;Linda thinks she about owns him. You see,
he&rsquo;s the only boy available about the school and
Linda has always been used to having the best of
everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So have you,&rdquo; laughed Nan, roguishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But not in boys!&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;Billy is enough.
If they are all like that brother of mine&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Walter isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! No! Walter Mason is as meek as
Moses! As meek as his own sister. And I think
Gracie is the most milk-and-watery girl I ever saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s timid, I know,&rdquo; began Nan, but her chum
interrupted quickly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! You&rsquo;ll find a good word to say for her,
Nan. You always champion the cause of the weak
and afflicted. Every sore-eyed kitten you saw on
the street at Tillbury used to appeal to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, bosh!&rdquo; exclaimed Nan. &ldquo;You make me out
a whole lot worse than I am.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[100]</span></p>

<p>The canoe suddenly dipped sideways and Bess
squealed as a splash of water came inboard. &ldquo;Sit
down! you&rsquo;re rocking the boat!&rdquo; she sang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a flaw of wind. Guess we&rsquo;ll have to
watch out. Don&rsquo;t tie the sheet to that cleat, Bess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sheet&rsquo;? Oh! you mean this rope. I never can
remember nautical names. But I&rsquo;ve got to hitch
the thing, Nan. I want to wash my hands. And
this water ought to be got out. There&rsquo;s a big sponge
in the bow-locker. There! I got that right, didn&rsquo;t
I? &lsquo;Bow locker.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan was steering with a paddle and could not
give her full attention to the sail. The sea was
choppy and it took some effort to keep the head of
the canoe properly pointed.</p>

<p>Nan was bare-headed, but Bess wore a rubber
bathing cap. Nan&rsquo;s braids snapped about her
shoulders when the boisterous wind swooped down
upon them. Farther out upon the lake white-caps
appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better not go very far to-day,&rdquo; Nan
said cautiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There go Walter and those girls!&rdquo; Bess cried.
&ldquo;Yes! Linda is aboard. What did I tell you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they can get back more quickly than <i>we</i>
can,&rdquo; Nan said seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go a little farther. I like it when the
canoe tumbles about,&rdquo; declared reckless Bess.</p>

<p>Nan knew that if the wind held at its present<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>
point it would be more aid to them in running back
than while they were on this present tack, so she
did not insist upon turning about immediately.
What she did not know was, that the recurrent flaws
in the wind foretold a sudden change in its direction.</p>

<p>There were plenty of other pleasure boats about
them at first; and as Bess pointed out, Walter Mason&rsquo;s
<i>Bargain Rush</i> had passed the canoe, going out.
What the two chums did not notice, however, was
that these other boats, including the <i>Bargain Rush</i>,
soon made for the shore.</p>

<p>The fishing boats from Freeling were driving in
toward the inlet, too. Wise boatmen saw the promise
of &ldquo;dirty weather.&rdquo; Not so Nan and Bess. The
tang of the spray on their lips, the wind blowing
their braids and freshening the roses in their cheeks,
the caress of it on their bare arms and necks, the
excitement of sitting in the pitching canoe&mdash;all delighted
and charmed the girls.</p>

<p>They were soon far from all other boats, the
canoe was scuttling over the choppy waves like a
quail running to cover, the bellying sail actually hiding
from their eyes the threatening clouds that were
piling up in the east and south.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wind died. Their sail hung flabbily
from the pole. Nan began to look anxiously about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we have to paddle clear back to the boathouse,&rdquo;
she began, when Bess suddenly gasped:<span class="pagenum">[102]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan! Look there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan gazed as her chum pointed &ldquo;sou&rsquo;east.&rdquo; A
mass of slate-colored clouds seemed to reach from
the apex of the heavenly arch to the lead-colored
water. Along the lower edge of this curtain of
cloud ran a white line, like the bared teeth of a
wolf!</p>

<p>Nan was for the moment speechless. She had
never seen such alarming clouds. She and Bess had
yet to see a storm on the Great Lakes. Nothing
like this approach of wind and rain had ever been
imagined by the two girls.</p>

<p>Out of the clouds came a low moaning&mdash;the
voice of the rising wind. Soon, too, the swish of
falling rain, which was beating the surface of the
water to foam as it advanced, was also audible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! what shall we do?&rdquo; moaned Bess.</p>

<p>Nan was aroused by this. She glanced wildly
around. They were a long way off Lighthouse
Point, at the entrance to Freeling Inlet, and the
storm was coming in such a direction that they must
be driven up the lake and away from the Hall boat-landing&mdash;if,
indeed, the canoe were not immediately
swamped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go the sheet, Bess! Let go the sheet!&rdquo; was
Nan&rsquo;s first cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness me! And the pillow cases, too, if you
say so!&rdquo; chattered Bess, clawing wildly at the rope
in question.<span class="pagenum">[103]</span></p>

<p>But she had tied it in a hard knot to the cleat, and
the more she tried to pull the knot loose, the tighter
it became.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quick! quick!&rdquo; Nan cried, trying to paddle the
canoe around.</p>

<p>She understood nothing about heading into the
wind&rsquo;s eye; Nan only realized that they would
likely be overturned if the wind and sea struck the
canoe broadside.</p>

<p>The storm which had, at first, approached so
slowly, now came down upon the canoe at terrific
speed. The wind shrieked, the spray flew before it
in a cloud, and the curtain of rain surrounded and
engulfed the two girls and their craft.</p>

<p>The sail was torn to shreds. Nan had managed
to head the canoe about and they took in the waves
over the stern. She was saturated to the very skin
by the first bucket of water.</p>

<p>Bess, with a wild scream of fear, cast herself
into Nan&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be drowned! we&rsquo;ll be drowned!&rdquo; was her
cry.</p>

<p>Nan thought so, too, but she tried to remain calm.</p>

<p>The water fairly boiled about them. It jumped
and pitched most awfully. The water that came
inboard threatened to swamp the canoe.</p>

<p>Peril, Nan had faced before; but nothing like
this. Each moment, as the canoe staggered on and
the waves rose higher and the wind shrieked louder,<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
Nan believed that they were nearer and nearer to
death.</p>

<p>She did not see how they could possibly escape
destruction. The sea fairly yawned for them. The
canoe sank lower and lower as the foam-streaked
water slopped in over the gunnels. <i>They were
going to be swamped!</i></p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[105]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>IN THE NICK OF TIME</small></h2>


<p>Bess Harley clung to her chum in an agony of
apprehension. Perhaps Nan would have utterly
given way to terror, too, had she not felt herself
obliged to bolster up poor Bess.</p>

<p>The wind shrieked so about the two girls, and
the roar of the rain and sea so deafened them, that
Nan could offer little verbal comfort. She could
only hug Bess close to her and pat her shoulder
caressingly.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Nan seized the bathing cap from
her chum&rsquo;s head, and, pushing Bess aside, began to
bail frantically with the rubber head covering. The
rain and spray were rapidly sinking the canoe, and
to free it of the accumulation of water was their
only hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! Oh, dear, Nan!&rdquo; groaned Bess, over
and over.</p>

<p>Nan had no breath left for idle talk. She bailed
out the water as fast as she could. The canoe was
too water-logged already to be easily steered. The
sea merely drove it on and on; providentially it
did not broach to.<span class="pagenum">[106]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Throw out the cushions!&rdquo; Nan finally cried to
her chum. &ldquo;Throw them out, it will lighten the
canoe a little.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but we&rsquo;ll have to pay for them,&rdquo; objected
Bess, for perhaps the first time in her life becoming
cautious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do as I say!&rdquo; commanded Nan. &ldquo;What are a
few cushions if we can save our lives?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we <i>can&rsquo;t!</i> We&rsquo;re sure to drown!&rdquo; wailed
Bess.</p>

<p>Nan was not at all sure that this was not true.
She would not, however, own up that she thought
so.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do as I say, Bess!&rdquo; she ordered. &ldquo;Throw
out the cushions! Never mind if we drown the next
minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you are awful!&rdquo; sobbed Bess.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, she jerked the cushions out over
the side. One after the other they floated away.
Then Nan was suddenly stricken with fear. Maybe
she had done the wrong thing. By the way the
cushions floated they might be of cork and if worse
came to worst, they might have been used as life-preservers.</p>

<p>But the canoe was lightened. Nan unhooked a
chair-back amidships and threw it overboard. All
the time she was bailing faithfully. After being
thus lightened, the canoe began to rise upon the
waves more buoyantly.<span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps, however, that was because the rain had
passed over. The driving sleet-like fall of it had
saturated the two girls in the canoe. They could
be no wetter now&mdash;not if they were completely
engulfed by the rising sea.</p>

<p>The violence of the wind had actually beaten the
sea down; but behind the squall, as it swept on, the
waves were rising tumultuously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t last long&mdash;it <i>can&rsquo;t</i> last long,&rdquo; Nan
thought.</p>

<p>She raised her eyes to look about. The darkness
of evening seemed already to hover upon the bosom
of the lake. The boat-landing and boathouse were
both out of sight. On the crag-like bluff the Hall
was merely a misty outline, hanging like a cloud-castle
in the air.</p>

<p>Bess was crying steadily. Nan thought of her
mother and her father, so far away. If anything
happened to her they would be a long time finding
it out.</p>

<p>And there was Uncle Henry and Aunt Kate and
the boys! They would feel very bad, Nan knew, if
anything happened to her. So would Toby Vanderwiller
and Mrs. Vanderwiller and Corson. And
perhaps queer little Margaret Llewellen and her
brother, Bob&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Was it the spray, or did tears fill Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s
eyes so that she could see nothing moving on the
face of the wild waters? Yet, of a sudden, there<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
came into hearing the sharp, staccato report of an
engine exhaust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A motor boat!&rdquo; Nan gasped, still bailing desperately.</p>

<p>The sputtering noise drew nearer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess!&rdquo; Nan cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Nan!&rdquo; responded her chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you hear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that boat,&rdquo; Bess said, sniffling. &ldquo;If they
only see us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you see them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan could not stop bailing. Every now and then
a wave would slop over the side and the canoe would
settle deeper in the lake.</p>

<p>Bess climbed unsteadily to her knees. Hope
revived in her breast. She wiped the spray out of
her eyes with the back of her hand and stared
all about. Yes! there was the darting motor
boat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Walter!&rdquo; she cried to her chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he see us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s going ri-i-ight past!&rdquo; wailed Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wave to him! Shout to him!&rdquo; commanded
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A lot of good tha-a-at&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; pursued the unhappy
Bess. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re so-o fa-a-ar away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan uttered a shriek just then that must have
been heard a long way down wind. A big wave
boarded them, filling the canoe almost full, and<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
throwing Bess on her face. Nan seized her chum
and drew her up out of the water so that she might
get her breath.</p>

<p>The canoe shook and staggered. It was going
down! Another such shipment of water and the
girls would be engulfed!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scream! Let&rsquo;s both scream together!&rdquo; commanded
Nan.</p>

<p>Her chum&rsquo;s cry was a very weak one indeed. But
Nan&rsquo;s voice rang out vigorously across the waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! We&rsquo;re sinking!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost immediately an answering cry came down
the wind:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold o-on! We&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what we&rsquo;re to hold onto,&rdquo;
gasped Nan, kneeling waist-deep in the water.</p>

<p>She had to hold up Bess, who was almost ready
to collapse. Left to herself, Nan&rsquo;s chum would
have succumbed before the motor boat arrived. It
was Walter&rsquo;s boat. To Nan&rsquo;s surprise, his sister
and Linda Riggs were still with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stand by for the buoy!&rdquo; called out Walter, and
flung the inflated ring attached to a strong line.</p>

<p>It floated near the submerged canoe almost at
once. Nan felt the canoe going down, and with
her arm about Bess, she flung herself away from
the sinking craft.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; gurgled Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep up!&rdquo; cried Nan.<span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sink, girls!&rdquo; shouted Walter Mason. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
get you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He, however, had his hands pretty full with the
boat. It had lost headway and was inclined to
swing broadside to the waves, which, every minute,
were running higher.</p>

<p>Nan and Bess were both good swimmers; yet
Bess was now all but helpless through fright. She
would have sunk immediately had not Nan&rsquo;s arm
been about her.</p>

<p>Nan struck out for the bobbing ring. A wave
carried them toward the life-buoy and as they fell
down the slant of that wave, they fairly plunged
onto the big canvas-covered ring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got it!&rdquo; yelled Nan, exultantly; and the
next moment water filled her mouth and she
swallowed so much that she felt almost water-logged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hang on!&rdquo; shouted Walter, encouragingly.</p>

<p>He started the screw again. Grace, who was
thoroughly frightened, made out, however, to hold
the wheel steady. Walter ran to the stern and
drew in the life-buoy, towing the imperiled girls
round to leeward of the plunging motor boat.</p>

<p>The rescue was barely in the nick of time. They
lifted Bess Harley over the low rail of the <i>Bargain
Rush</i>, almost senseless. Nan managed to climb in
unaided. They were not much wetter than those
already aboard the motor boat.<span class="pagenum">[111]</span></p>

<p>Linda was very ill, and hung over the rail forward.
Grace was crying, amidships, and trying to
steer the boat while Walter tinkered with the engine.
Bess and Nan lay in the cockpit, recovering
from their fight with the sea.</p>

<p>It was a very miserable party, indeed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>THE BOATHOUSE GHOST</small></h2>


<p>Between her throes of sea-sickness, Linda began
to be heard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forgive you, never, Walter Mason!
Nor you, either, Grace! You brought me out here
to drown me! I&rsquo;ll tell my father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This had probably been going on for some time
before Nan and her chum were assisted aboard the
<i>Bargain Rush</i>. Walter seemed to be pretty well
disgusted with the railroad magnate&rsquo;s daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell your father till you get ashore, Linda,&rdquo;
he advised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just as horrid as you can be!&rdquo; gasped
Linda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind him, Linda,&rdquo; begged peace-loving
Grace. &ldquo;And, really, it isn&rsquo;t his fault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just as bad as he is, every whit!&rdquo; snapped
the unpleasant girl. &ldquo;You both were determined
to come out here when I wanted to go ashore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; gasped Grace, showing some pluck for
once, &ldquo;you wouldn&rsquo;t have had Walter leave Nan
and Bess to drown, would you?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[113]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And now we&rsquo;re <i>all</i> going to be drowned!&rdquo; was
Linda&rsquo;s response, but hastily leaning over the rail
again, her voice was stifled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If&mdash;if I ever get to shore alive,&rdquo; she finally
wailed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never even go in wading again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Had the situation really not seemed so tragic,
Nan would have laughed. Bess had joined Linda
at the rail, being just as sick as the other. Grace
looked green about the lips, herself; but she was
plucky. Nan felt no qualms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let me take the wheel, Walter,&rdquo; she said to
Grace&rsquo;s brother. &ldquo;I know how to steer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good for you, Miss Sherwood!&rdquo; cried the boy.
&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re not afraid, either?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not <i>much</i>,&rdquo; answered Nan, stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boat&rsquo;s as safe as a house. The squall&rsquo;s gone
over now. We&rsquo;ll soon get to land. Let her off
another point now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan obeyed. The propeller began kicking in
regular time. They were able to head around toward
the shore. Walter soon took the wheel again
and guided the <i>Bargain Rush</i> more directly toward
the anchorage before the Hall. They were all of
three miles from the boathouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it all right now, Miss Sherwood,&rdquo;
said Walter, cheerfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was awfully good of you to come out for us,&rdquo;
Nan said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! we couldn&rsquo;t do less, could we?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess Linda wouldn&rsquo;t have come if she had
had her way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! Grace isn&rsquo;t that kind,&rdquo; said the brother,
loyally. &ldquo;Of course, we would have done everything
in our power to save you girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we will never forget it!&rdquo; Nan cried
warmly. &ldquo;We would have drowned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Walter, in embarrassment.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I guess the other girls don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; said
Nan, suddenly observing her chum and the other
two. All three were violently sick. &ldquo;It is awfully
rough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re catching these waves sideways,&rdquo; Walter
said. &ldquo;Wait till we get in the lea of Lighthouse
Point. It won&rsquo;t be so bad then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a true prophecy, and the <i>Bargain Rush</i>
was soon sailing on even keel. Linda, as well as
the other girls, recovered in a measure from the
feeling of nausea that had gripped them. As soon
as the vulgar girl regained her voice she began to
scold again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d never been in all this trouble if you&rsquo;d listened
to me, Walter Mason! This is awful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s better now, Linda,&rdquo; said Walter, cheerfully.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll soon be at the Hall dock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s where you should have landed Grace
and me just as soon as the storm came up,&rdquo; grumbled
Linda.<span class="pagenum">[115]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But we saw the canoe in trouble&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see it!&rdquo; snapped the girl, crossly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I did,&rdquo; Walter said warmly. &ldquo;It would
have been a wicked and inhuman thing to have
turned away. We had to save Miss Sherwood and
Miss Harley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And risk <i>my</i> life doing it!&rdquo; cried Linda. &ldquo;I
shall tell my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you tell your father everything you promise
to,&rdquo; said Walter, with some spirit, &ldquo;he must be an
awfully busy man just attending to your complaints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my!&rdquo; gasped Bess, with wan delight. Meek
Walter Mason was beginning to show boldness in
dealing with the purse-proud girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nasty thing!&rdquo; snapped Linda to Walter.
&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get over that,&rdquo; muttered the boy to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your sister is just as bad!&rdquo; scolded Linda,
giving way to her dreadful temper as Nan and Bess
had seen her do on the train. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you both
that you can&rsquo;t treat me in any such way. I&rsquo;ve
always stood up for your dunce of a sister. That&rsquo;s
what she is, a dunce!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you were a boy, I&rsquo;d thrash you for saying
that!&rdquo; declared Walter, quietly, though in a white
heat of passion himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; shrieked Linda. &ldquo;So you threaten to
strike me, do you? If I tell my father <i>that</i>&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, tell him!&rdquo; exclaimed Walter, in exasperation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of all the mean girls!&rdquo; murmured Bess, with
her arm about Grace, who was crying softly and
begging her brother to desist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I can see what&rsquo;s caused all this,&rdquo; went on
Linda, in her high-pitched voice. &ldquo;Grace was
mighty glad to have me and my friends even look
at her before Nan Sherwood and Bess Harley came
to the Hall. I wish her all the benefit she may
derive from associating with <i>them</i>. I know one is
a thief and the other is no better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess turned upon the enraged girl with an angry
retort. But Nan stopped her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t reply, Bess,&rdquo; said Nan, in a low voice.
&ldquo;Brawling never proves anything, or settles any
argument. But if she keeps on saying in public
that I am a thief I shall go to Dr. Prescott about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t be a tell-tale?&rdquo; gasped Bess, horrified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In this case I will,&rdquo; Nan said firmly. &ldquo;And she
shall apologize in public.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Linda, by this time, had, in a measure, quieted
down. She was sobbing angrily and did not hear
what Nan said. The other young people left her
strictly alone until the <i>Bargain Rush</i> reached the
dock.</p>

<p>Oddly enough not even the boatkeeper, Henry,<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
had discovered the absence of the canoe in which
Nan and Bess had sailed away from the landing two
hours and more before. The other boats had come
in, in a hurry, when the squall arose, and it was
now so late that all the girls had gone up the bluff.
The supper gong would sound soon.</p>

<p>Henry had gone to his supper, intending to return
later to put all the boats under cover and lock
up the house. The girls said Henry was afraid of
the boathouse ghost himself, and would never go
into the building after dusk without a lantern.</p>

<p>Linda stepped ashore and marched away with
her head in the air. Grace had permission to go
home with her brother to supper. Mr. Mason, who
was an influential lawyer, owned a country home
up the lake shore, beyond Professor Krenner&rsquo;s
queer little cabin, and the brother and sister proposed
going to their home in the <i>Bargain Rush</i>.
Grace would return to the Hall later, by automobile.</p>

<p>Nan and Bess were grateful to Walter and Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We cannot tell you how we feel, <i>inside</i>, Walter,&rdquo;
Nan said softly. &ldquo;Nothing we can ever do for you
will repay you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; begged the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to hear your praises sung!&rdquo; cried
Bess, laughing and sobbing at once. &ldquo;I shall write
home to my folks about it. And we shall tell all
the girls.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; gasped the embarrassed
youth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your sister will never miss Linda Riggs&rsquo;
friendship,&rdquo; said Nan, stoutly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see that
Linda does not bother her, either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;re so brave, Nan,&rdquo; murmured the
timid Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take much courage to face a girl like
Linda,&rdquo; Nan retorted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen already that she
has very few real friends in the school, and those
she has to pay high to keep. I would rather have
her for an enemy than a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan and Bess kissed Grace and shook hands
with her brother. The chums were both as wet as
they could be, and the evening air felt chill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get our sweaters,&rdquo; Nan said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! they&rsquo;re in the dressing room of the boathouse,&rdquo;
objected Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know it,&rdquo; her chum said, starting off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Nan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sup&mdash;suppose we <i>see</i> something?&rdquo; gasped Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, we want to see something,&rdquo; said Nan,
puzzled. &ldquo;We want to see our sweaters. And we
want to feel them, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t mean that,&rdquo; insisted Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know what they say,&rdquo; objected Bess Harley.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s haunted!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[119]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare! you don&rsquo;t believe that foolishness, do
you, Bess Harley?&rdquo; cried Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I believe it or not,&rdquo; confessed
her chum. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to see any
ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you ever will, honey,&rdquo; Nan said,
more seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can laugh&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not laughing: But we can&rsquo;t stand here and
take cold. We want those sweaters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not go,&rdquo; Bess whispered, hanging
back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then <i>I&rsquo;ll</i> go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want you to leave me alone,&rdquo; objected
Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the greatest girl I ever saw!&rdquo; sputtered
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know I&rsquo;m a coward,&rdquo; said her friend, shakingly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have given up all hope and been
drowned, out there on the lake, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
you, dear Nan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! Come on! Let&rsquo;s get the sweaters.
It&rsquo;s almost supper time and Mrs. Cupp will give us
fits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t, for I shall tell her just how brave
you were, and how Walter saved us both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; cried Nan. &ldquo;After being through what
we have this afternoon, Bess, I shouldn&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;d be afraid of the dark.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[120]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> dark,&rdquo; murmured Bess, as they approached
the boathouse.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; repeated Nan, gently scornful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you won&rsquo;t &lsquo;bah&rsquo; so much before we get
out,&rdquo; whispered Bess, as they entered the open door
and approached the girls&rsquo; dressing room and lockers.</p>

<p>They had to cross the big room where the boats
were hauled up the sloping plank floor from the
cove. It was dark and mysterious.</p>

<p>Suddenly Bess clutched her chum by the arm.
&ldquo;Oh-o-o!&rdquo; she moaned faintly.</p>

<p>Her shaking hand indicated the direction of a
window across the room. It was lighter outside the
boathouse than it was within. Against the gray
background of the window-pane moved a figure!
A black figure! A human figure!</p>

<p>The two girls halted and clung together. Even
Nan&rsquo;s heart beat faster.</p>

<p>The figure moved slowly across the window opening.
It made no sound. It disappeared for a moment
and then reappeared before a second window.
It was all in black and not very tall. It was soon
gone entirely.</p>

<p>The girls heard no door open and close. It was
just as though the black figure had evaporated&mdash;melted
into the air!</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ghost! What did I tell you, Nan Sherwood?&rdquo;
moaned Bess.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>RELATING IT ALL</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; declared Nan Sherwood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You saw it with your own eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe my own eyes, then!&rdquo; was Nan&rsquo;s
energetic rejoinder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I know I saw it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t convince me in the least, Bess
Harley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! you are the most obstinate girl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t own up to such foolishness!&rdquo; cried Nan,
hotly. &ldquo;A ghost <i>just doesn&rsquo;t exist!&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>They were back in their own room at Lakeview
Hall. Bess could not have told for the life of her
how they had obtained their sweaters out of the
locker, put them on, and escaped from the boathouse.
But she knew that somehow Nan had kept
her from running away in a panic.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Nan, we <i>saw</i> it!&rdquo; Bess reiterated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Saw what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We saw nothing of the kind. We saw something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[122]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But a ghost is nothing. We could not see a
spirit. That was something palpable we saw. It
crossed in front of two windows and we could not
see through it. It had a solid body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;ell,&rdquo; Bess returned. &ldquo;There may be solid
ghosts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t stand to reason. There&rsquo;s supper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want supper much,&rdquo; said Bess, shivering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go down and ask Susan for hot tea.
That&rsquo;s what we need,&rdquo; said practical Nan. &ldquo;And
let&rsquo;s keep still about this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;About Walter and all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! I mean about what we saw at the boathouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you do admit we saw something?&rdquo; cried
Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said Nan drily. &ldquo;We did see
something. Therefore it was not a ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her insistence on this point vexed Bess not a little.
She felt that they had seen a strange thing,
and she wanted to tell the other girls about it. But
what would be the use of doing that if her chum
pooh-poohed the idea of a ghost and merely went to
Henry, as she threatened to, and told him that some
tramp, or other prowler, was hanging about the
boathouse?</p>

<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said Nan, &ldquo;the girls keep bathing suits
and sweaters and all sorts of things down there<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
and that fellow, whoever he is, may be light-fingered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; grumbled Bess, &ldquo;you never are romantic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! what&rsquo;s romantic about a disembodied
spirit? Smells of the tomb!&rdquo; declared Nan.</p>

<p>There was one thing, however, that had to be
told. The canoe was lost and Mrs. Cupp must be
informed at once. So after supper the two chums
sought that stern lady&rsquo;s room, which was right at
the top of the basement stairs.</p>

<p>As Nan and Bess approached this &ldquo;ogress&rsquo; castle,&rdquo;
as the girls called Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s room, a tall,
thin lady was going in ahead of them. She had on
her coat and hat and was evidently a visitor from
outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; whispered Nan, to her
chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I know,&rdquo; Bess replied eagerly. &ldquo;One of
the girls pointed her out to me on the street and I
never <i>could</i> forget that funny, old-fashioned hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; exclaimed Nan, hanging back, &ldquo;who is
she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s sister. She lives alone in the village.
She&rsquo;s a milliner. That&rsquo;s why she wears such
an awful hat, I suppose,&rdquo; giggled Bess. &ldquo;By the
same token shoemakers&rsquo; wives go almost barefoot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; breathed Nan.</p>

<p>The visitor&rsquo;s high-pitched, querulous voice<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
reached their ears plainly, for she had not taken
pains to close the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, Ida, what did I tell you?&rdquo; she began.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s back again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! how you startled me, Sadie Vane,&rdquo;
was Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s response. She had evidently been
sitting at her desk with her back to the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be more startled, Ida Cupp, when you
hear what I have to tell you,&rdquo; Miss Vane went on
to say hurriedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! do shut the door. You needn&rsquo;t tell it to
the whole school, Sadie,&rdquo; said the matron, sharply.</p>

<p>The door banged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is no time for us to interview Mrs. Cupp,&rdquo;
said Nan, sensibly, and she and her chum withdrew.</p>

<p>Linda Riggs had confided a garbled account of
the boating accident to her particular chum and
roommate, Cora Courtney. Of course, Cora eagerly
spread the tidings. There was a group of excited
girls in the main study when Nan and Bess came
through the front hall, ready to pounce on them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, sawneys!&rdquo; ordered Mabel Schiff, a big
girl who would graduate from the Hall at the end
of the school year. &ldquo;Come in here and give an
account of yourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not, Nan,&rdquo; whispered Bess, hanging back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; commanded the big girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Nan asked her chum. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve all
got to know about it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a friend of Linda&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Bess again whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll find out what Linda has told,&rdquo; Nan
said, and boldly entered the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said the big girl. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t look
much like a couple of drowned rats. They tell me
you&rsquo;ve been overboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We got wet,&rdquo; admitted Nan, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got wet! Why, you lost your canoe, and were
almost drowned, and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Linda
Riggs, you wouldn&rsquo;t have been saved!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In spite of her we were saved, is nearer the
truth,&rdquo; Nan declared, but without showing any of
the warmth that Bess was beginning to display.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How ridiculous! She saw you and made that
Mason boy sail over to you and pick you up, didn&rsquo;t
she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, she didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; snapped Bess, quite losing her
temper now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course you kids would say that,&rdquo; scoffed
the big girl. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like Linda. But poor
Linda was so sick she couldn&rsquo;t come down to supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She was sicker out in that boat,&rdquo; Bess said, with
a laugh. &ldquo;You should have seen her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you can laugh?&rdquo; groaned Miss Schiff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was no laughing matter for a while,&rdquo; Nan
put in, good-naturedly. &ldquo;We really were in great
trouble. Our canoe was lost&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to pay for that, children,&rdquo; Mabel
Schiff cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know all that!&rdquo; Bess returned smartly.
&ldquo;And our folks are quite as well able to pay for the
old thing as Linda&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush, Bess!&rdquo; begged Nan, <i>sotto voce</i>. This
sort of talk did sound so common!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I&rsquo;m sick of hearing about Linda&rsquo;s
riches,&rdquo; Bess rejoined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you girls think you saved yourselves?&rdquo;
the big girl went on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; we did not,&rdquo; Nan said, with seriousness.
&ldquo;Walter Mason saved us. We would have drowned
had it not been for Walter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! of course it was his boat&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was Walter himself who did it all,&rdquo; Nan went
on, enthusiastically. &ldquo;He is as brave as he can be.&rdquo;
She then related the whole incident, just as it had
taken place. The girls listened attentively at last,
for the story of the squall and the boating accident
that followed it, with the details of the rescue, lost
nothing in Nan&rsquo;s telling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great! great!&rdquo; shouted Laura Polk, when Nan
finished. &ldquo;You ought to be class historian, Nancy
Sherwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how about Linda?&rdquo; suggested another girl,
slily. &ldquo;She is some historian, too, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now, Nan had said nothing in her veracious tale
about the purse-proud girl; but Mabel Schiff said:<span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe all that. I guess Linda was there
as much as these freshies&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she was!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess, excitedly. &ldquo;And
all she did was to be ill, over the rail of the boat,
and scold Walter for making any effort to save us.
That&rsquo;s the sort of a girl Linda is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That sounds a good deal like her,&rdquo; announced
the red-haired girl, bluntly. &ldquo;Linda Riggs can&rsquo;t
pull the wool over our eyes&mdash;much! We&rsquo;ve all seen
enough of her to know pretty much what she would
do at such a time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re all jealous of her,&rdquo; sniffed Mabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; laughed Laura. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re jealous of her
kind disposition, her honey-dripping tongue, and
her delightfully social ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And her money!&rdquo; flashed Mabel.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said May Winslow, a peace-loving and,
withal, ladylike girl&mdash;&ldquo;I think we have discussed
an absent fellow-pupil quite enough. Let us say
nothing about Linda that we would not say to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, goodness!&rdquo; cried the impulsive Bess. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
say just what I think of her, to her face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would not make it the less ill-natured,&rdquo;
said May, quietly.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>A LARK IN PROSPECT</small></h2>


<p>Dr. Beulah Prescott herself heard of the
chums&rsquo; adventure and called Nan and Bess into her
office before bedtime.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is all this I hear about your trying to cross
Lake Huron in an open boat?&rdquo; asked the principal,
lightly.</p>

<p>But she looked grave enough before Nan had
finished her true and particular narrative of the incident.
Dr. Prescott did not scold the chums, as Mrs.
Cupp certainly would have done. But she went
much more thoroughly into the affair than the
matron could, or would.</p>

<p>She sent for Henry, the boatkeeper, and that
rather careless individual learned that he was expected
to have a closer oversight over the use of
the boats by the girls at all times; and especially
was he to watch the weather signals which were
flown from the pole at the life-saving station on
Lighthouse Point.</p>

<p>Nan said nothing to the principal of the school
about the person she and Bess had seen prowling
about the boathouse. She thought that for once
probably Henry had enough trouble!<span class="pagenum">[129]</span></p>

<p>When Grace Mason got back to the Hall at nine
o&rsquo;clock, she was also called in to see &ldquo;Dr. Beulah,&rdquo;
as most of the girls affectionately called the preceptress.
But Linda was not called upon to give
her version of the adventure at all.</p>

<p>Later the preceptress wrote a very nice letter to
Walter Mason&rsquo;s father, commending his son for
the bravery and good sense he had shown in saving
the girl canoeists. Nan, and Bess, and even Grace,
were made a good deal of by the other girls because
of the adventure. And every time Walter
Mason came to see his sister, Grace asked permission
for Nan and Bess to meet him, too. In this
way the chums from Tillbury got many an automobile
ride and boat ride that they would not otherwise
have enjoyed.</p>

<p>Because of this new association of Nan and Bess
with Grace and her brother, Linda Riggs&rsquo; tongue
dripped venom, not honey. The rich girl had gathered
around her a coterie of girls like Cora Courtney
and Mabel Schiff, and they echoed Linda&rsquo;s ill-natured
remarks and ridiculous stories. The great
number of the older girls at Lakeview Hall, as Nan
had very sensibly said, paid no attention whatsoever
to the ill-natured talk of Linda Riggs&rsquo; clique.
As for those girls smaller and younger than Nan
and Bess (and there were many of them) they were
little interested in the controversy.</p>

<p>Of course, right at the beginning of her school<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
life at Lakeview Hall, Nan Sherwood had made
friends with the little girls. They all soon learned
that Nan was sympathetic, could enter into their
play with perfect equality, was glad to help them in
their lessons, and altogether filled the part of &ldquo;Big
Sister&rdquo; to perfection.</p>

<p>Bess did not care so much for children. Perhaps
it was because she had some bothersome small
brothers and sisters at home. Nan, who was an
only child, had always longed for a brother or sister.
Although she could not remember him, the
tiny brother who had lived a short few weeks at
the &ldquo;little dwelling in amity,&rdquo; and then had gone
away forever, was much in Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s
thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It gets me,&rdquo; Bess sputtered once to her chum,
&ldquo;how you can actually play dolls with those primary
kids&mdash;a big girl like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like dolls,&rdquo; said Nan, placidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! I believe you do,&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;I wonder
you don&rsquo;t litter up our room with &rsquo;em&mdash;and doll
clothes and baby carriages and cradles,&rdquo; and Bess
laughed gaily, with no idea of how close she had
come to touching upon Nan&rsquo;s secret.</p>

<p>Dr. Prescott did not make the chums pay for
the lost canoe, so Nan, relieved of the necessity for
doing so, decided not to tell her father and mother
about the canoe accident, as she knew they would<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
worry needlessly. Nor did careless Bess tell her
parents. Bess had a strong personal reason for
keeping the adventure a secret. She did not want
to put any obstacle in the way of the purchase of
the boat she was teasing for.</p>

<p>Nan was writing long and enthusiastic letters to
Scotland. In return she received from both &ldquo;Momsey&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Papa Sherwood&rdquo; most encouraging reports
of the progress of the court proceedings over
Mr. Hughie Blake&rsquo;s will, under the terms of which
Mrs. Sherwood was to receive considerable wealth.
It seemed that the controversy was practically finished,
and Nan&rsquo;s parents would soon be coming
home. In one of these letters, received early in the
school year, Nan found a five pound note &ldquo;to do
just what she pleased with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! what&rsquo;ll you do with so much money?&rdquo;
gasped Bess. &ldquo;And all in a bunch. Twenty-five
dollars! Why, Nan, your father must be richer
than mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They know I haven&rsquo;t had much heretofore to
spend extravagantly,&rdquo; responded Nan, her eyes
twinkling, &ldquo;while you have been extravagant all
your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! My father never gives me such a sum all
at once for spending money. But you&rsquo;re so cautious,
Nan. Ugh! &lsquo;sensible!&rsquo; I hate that word!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So do I dislike it,&rdquo; said Nan, briskly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
think I am any more sensible than other girls&mdash;unless
I&rsquo;m more so than you, Bess,&rdquo; and she laughed
at her chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! what will you do with your money?&rdquo;
asked Bess. &ldquo;That will tell the story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a regular big junket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Treat the whole school to ice-cream?&rdquo;
laughed Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! ice-cream melts too fast. It&rsquo;s all over too
soon,&rdquo; returned Bess, with a frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Buy lollypops, then&mdash;or jaw-breakers? They
last longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say! this is no time to joke. It&rsquo;s serious,&rdquo; declared
Bess, putting her mind to the matter of the
disbursement of her chum&rsquo;s windfall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Nan. &ldquo;The Committee on
Entertainment will now go into executive session.
What&rsquo;s your idea, Elizabeth, about buying every
one of the two hundred girls at Lakeview Hall a
twelve-and-a-half cent rubber doll?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doll? Pah! your mind runs on dolls, Nan Sherwood.
You are certainly getting into your second
childhood,&rdquo; said Bess, with disgust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; admitted Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do let&rsquo;s be serious,&rdquo; Bess begged again. &ldquo;What
is the most popular thing among the girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those new side-combs!&rdquo; exclaimed Nan.<span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;and I&rsquo;m going to have a pair just as soon
as mother sends me my next spending money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy you a pair,&rdquo; said generous Nan, quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t, silly! I&rsquo;ll not let you fritter
away any of that perfectly splendid five pound note
in foolishness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; responded Nan, drily, much amused to
hear Bess Harley so very practical.</p>

<p>The practicality of the discussion might be doubted
by anybody save boarding-school girls. Bess
quickly proved to her own satisfaction, if not
entirely to Nan&rsquo;s, that the small, &ldquo;after-hours supper&rdquo;
was the most popular form of entertainment
then in vogue at Lakeview Hall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know, Cora Courtney and that crowd are
always talking about a strawberry festival that she
and Linda Riggs engineered last June. And now
they are planning to have another big spread soon
in some room on their corridor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Nan, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t be invited to
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. And they won&rsquo;t be invited to ours,&rdquo; cried
Bess, promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we have a spread,&rdquo; agreed Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the thing,&rdquo; Bess pursued, very enthusiastic.
&ldquo;Eating promotes fellowship&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And indigestion,&rdquo; laughed Nan. &ldquo;Especially
such a combination as Laura had in her room the<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
other night&mdash;sour pickles, ice-cream cones, and
salted peanuts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! that was fierce!&rdquo; acknowledged Bess.
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t eat much; but I felt squirmy, just the
same, after it. But if we give the girls the big
eats, let&rsquo;s have something nice, but digestible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s!&rdquo; agreed Nan. &ldquo;Of course, it&rsquo;s against
the rules&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, now! don&rsquo;t begin that,&rdquo; begged Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;ell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They all do it. If Dr. Beulah wasn&rsquo;t so awfully
strict about our having what she calls a &lsquo;plain,
wholesome supper,&rsquo; and refusing to let us add
sweets, and the like, to the supper bill-of-fare,
I&rsquo;m sure the girls wouldn&rsquo;t be dying for these
spreads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the girls had what they wanted at supper,
Dr. Prescott would have to charge about twice what
she does now for tuition and board at Lakeview
Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said Bess, briskly. &ldquo;The
question is: Shall we have the spread?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; agreed Nan.</p>

<p>So it was decided. With twenty-five dollars they
could have a bountiful feast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A dollar a plate will give us a delightful supper,
with salad, and ices, and all,&rdquo; said Bess, who
knew more about such things than Nan, for her
mother entertained a great deal in Tillbury.<span class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But how&rsquo;ll we ever get such things up to our
room?&rdquo; gasped Nan.</p>

<p>That puzzled Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And twenty-five girls would just about swamp
us,&rdquo; Nan added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hire a hall?&rdquo; suggested Nan, roguishly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, don&rsquo;t, Nan Sherwood! You&rsquo;re dreadful!&rdquo;
cried Bess, almost in tears as she saw her castle in
the air dissolving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; commanded Nan, good-naturedly patting
her chum on the shoulder. &ldquo;All is not yet lost!
Up and at &rsquo;em, guards! Never say die!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d just set my heart on the biggest kind of a
spread,&rdquo; mourned Bess. &ldquo;I wanted anything Cora,
and Linda, and Mabel, and that set did, to look
like a punctured jitney.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess! what language!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;ell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now let me think,&rdquo; said Nan, seriously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thoughts, of course, goosey!&rdquo; laughed Nan.
&ldquo;Wait! First we must plan to have the spread in
a sufficiently roomy place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s got to be in the Hall,&rdquo; cried Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or near it,&rdquo; suggested Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; commanded Nan, dramatically. &ldquo;I
have thought of just the place. We can get the<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
goodies brought around from the caterer in Freeling,
in a boat, and nobody&rsquo;ll be the wiser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where&mdash;what?&rdquo; demanded Bess.</p>

<p>So Nan told her.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE FATEFUL EVENING DRAWS NEAR</small></h2>


<p>Bess Harley had said the discussion of how to
spend the five pound note was a serious matter;
and when the conference was concluded and the
two chums separated to attend different classes,
Bess&rsquo; countenance certainly looked very grave.</p>

<p>Nan was secretly amused at the way in which her
friend had taken the suggestion as to the place at
which the proposed feast should be held. The
thought had come to Nan in a flash; but to carry
the scheme through was to test the courage of some
of her school friends.</p>

<p>Bess was too proud, after all, to refuse to meet
the terms on which her chum agreed to give the
banquet; but it was plain she thought the suggestion
a risky one. So she carried a rather glum face
to Mademoiselle&rsquo;s music class, while Nan sought
Professor Krenner for&mdash;yes!&mdash;a lesson in architectural
drawing.</p>

<p>Actually, Nan had taken up this elective study.
She had demurely marked a cross against that study
at first, in a spirit of mischief. She liked queer old
Professor Krenner from the start; and she had<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
threatened on the train coming up from Chicago,
to become his pupil in the art which he admitted was
his hobby. The professor was surprised nevertheless
when Dr. Prescott passed Nan&rsquo;s name over to
him without comment.</p>

<p>But once caught in the mesh of his own net, Professor
Krenner was game. He put Nan down
before him in the classroom, where the boards were
for the most part covered with mathematical problems,
and began to talk seriously, but in a popular
strain, of form, color, and periods of architecture.</p>

<p>He was interested himself and he interested Nan.
She took fire from his enthusiasm. He went to the
board and illustrated his meaning with bold, rapid
strokes of the chalk. He even erased problems and
examples, in his eagerness to explain to an intelligent,
youthful mind, ideas that he had long since
evolved but had not put into words before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoity-toity!&rdquo; he cried at last, in his odd, querulous
way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve rubbed out half my work for to-morrow.
Nancy Sherwood, you&rsquo;ve bewitched me.
You&rsquo;ve set me talking on a theme I don&rsquo;t often
touch. Now, are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to be just awfully interested,&rdquo;
Nan declared, rising with a sigh. &ldquo;Is the lesson
over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! &rsquo;tis over,&rdquo; he growled, looking ruefully at
his free-hand elevation of the Colosseum at Rome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when do I come again?&rdquo; asked Nan.<span class="pagenum">[139]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh? And do you wish to continue this course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I truly believe I&rsquo;d like to see if I have a talent
for architecture. I&rsquo;m awfully interested. It&rsquo;s lots
more entertaining than drawing butterflies and
flowers. Can&rsquo;t a woman be an architect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoity-toity! what&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; asked the professor,
and sat down again to stare at her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really do like it, Professor,&rdquo; repeated Nan.</p>

<p>And from that time there dated a friendship between,
and companionship of, Nan Sherwood and
Professor Krenner that really made a great difference
in both their lives.</p>

<p>Just now both chums from Tillbury were, immensely
interested in the secret banquet to which
twenty-five of their closest friends were to be
invited. Nor was it a small task to select those two
score and five out of a possible hundred&mdash;for,
of course, the &ldquo;primes,&rdquo; or lower-grade girls, were
not considered at all.</p>

<p>And then, there was the possibility of some of
the invited guests being unwilling to attend. They
had to face that from the start.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know very well,&rdquo; said Bess, when she had
digested Nan&rsquo;s idea for a day or two, and grown
more accustomed to it&mdash;&ldquo;You know very well that
wild horses wouldn&rsquo;t drag May Winslow to the
feast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know how she feels about that place.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s one of the very girls I want there,&rdquo;
cried Nan. &ldquo;We want to kill superstition and have
a grand feast at one fell swoop. It&rsquo;s all nonsense!
Some of the little girls have got hold of the foolish
stories that have been told and they are almost
afraid to go to bed at night in their big dormitories
with all the other girls about them. It&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, Nan!&rdquo; groaned her chum. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
too, too bold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t take much boldness to disbelieve such
old-wives&rsquo; fables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your own eyesight, too?&rdquo; suggested Bess,
slily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never admit I have seen anything either spiritual
or spirituous,&rdquo; laughed Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they say there are underground passages
from the unfinished part of the Hall, down there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What were they for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe smugglers,&rdquo; replied Bess, big-eyed at her
own thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! I never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lots of smuggling about Freeling years ago.
Henry says so,&rdquo; declared Bess, stoutly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! what have you been reading?&rdquo; demanded
Nan. &ldquo;Dime novels, I do believe, Bess
Harley!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just wait!&rdquo; said her chum, prophetically. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
afraid we&rsquo;ll get into trouble over this after all.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[141]</span></p>

<p>And she was quite right; but it was not at all
the sort of trouble Bess expected.</p>

<p>The chums obtained permission to go down town
shopping and they made arrangements with the
caterer for the supper to be ready on a certain evening&mdash;salads,
sandwiches, and cake in hampers;
cream packed in ice; coffee and chocolate ready to
warm on a stove which Nan knew would be in
readiness; and plates, cups and saucers, knives and
forks, and all other needfuls packed in proper containers,
to be transported by water.</p>

<p>Nan had already bribed Henry; for the place
where she was determined to have the banquet was
in an unused part of the big boathouse, a sort of
kitchen and dining room where there was a stove.
Picnics had been held there before; but never at
night. Many of the girls had declared they would
not go there after dark because of the ghost. But
Nan was determined to prick the bubble of that
superstition. Where one girl would not go for fear
of the supernatural, twenty-five would be afraid not
to go because of the ridicule that would fall upon
them.</p>

<p>Grace Mason and her roommate, the flaxen-haired
Lillie Nevin, were among those who Bess had
prophesied would not dare attend the banquet at
the haunted boathouse. But Nan pleaded with
them. She had to get Grace interested, for Nan
desired to make use of Walter and his <i>Bargain<span class="pagenum">[142]</span>
Rush</i>. The caterer could not deliver the supper
after dark at the Lakeview Hall boat landing; but
Walter could, and gladly agreed to do so. It was
his enthusiasm over the proposed party that encouraged
Grace&mdash;and through her, Lillie&mdash;to promise
to attend.</p>

<p>Nan went to May Winslow in a personal way,
too. She showed May, who was one of the larger
girls, that her example would go far to kill the
foolish belief rife among the girls that the boathouse
was haunted.</p>

<p>Nan and Bess had never told any of their mates
about their own strange experience in the boathouse.
Nothing new had developed regarding the haunt.
The &ldquo;black ghost&mdash;all black&rdquo; had not been reported
seen since the previous spring. So the general excitement
rife in the school at that time had subsided.</p>

<p>Gradually Nan and Bess spoke to, and obtained
the promise of attendance of twenty-five girls. Each
was bound to secrecy; but a secret among twenty-five
girls has about as much chance as a kitten in a
kennel of fox terriers.</p>

<p>It was whispered from one to the other that Nan
Sherwood had twenty-five dollars&mdash;some said fifty&mdash;to
spend on a single &ldquo;spread.&rdquo; The girls were
eager to be invited; all were curious; and the Linda
Riggs clique was clamorously jealous.</p>

<p>Did they never study or work? Was it all fun
and adventure at Lakeview Hall? No, no, indeed!
There was plenty of work, and Nan Sherwood, with
Bess Harley and her other friends, said they were
&ldquo;actually worked to death&rdquo; by some of the teachers.
For the very reason that they did do so much, their
minds in hours of relaxation turned to such frolics
as this one planned at the haunted boathouse.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Loro was a little, dried, winter-leaf
Frenchwoman, as quick and active as a cat and
with beadlike black eyes, more like a bird&rsquo;s than
those of a human being.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Loro fairly slaved to make stubborn
and careless girls attain a Parisian accent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And about all we get from the poor old dear,&rdquo;
Laura said, &ldquo;is a Paris-Kentucky accent and an
ability to shrug our shoulders. Goodness! she&rsquo;s
got me doing that, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As for the German teacher, Frau Deuseldorf, she
was of a different type entirely. A tall, formidable
looking woman was Frau Deuseldorf, with a magnificent<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
air, no waistline, and a wart on her nose.
Nan, whenever she stood before the good lady,
never <i>could</i> see anything of the teacher&rsquo;s face save
that unfortunate blemish.</p>

<p>Perhaps the teacher whom the girls as a whole
disliked the most was Professor Krenner. He was
a martinet in mathematics; whereas Nan found him
a most lovable and delightful instructor in architectural
drawing. It finally became a regular practice
for the architectural drawing class to attend
the professor&rsquo;s lecture at his own cabin, one afternoon
a week. And these afternoons were most delightfully
spent.</p>

<p>Nan did not go alone. She had interested in the
study another girl, and oddly enough that was &ldquo;Procrastination
Boggs.&rdquo; Amelia Boggs, from Wauhegan,
was certainly peculiar; but Nan had learned
to like her very quickly.</p>

<p>Amelia told Nan all about the clocks and watches.
Her father owned a store in Wauhegan, which had
been let to a jeweler and clock-dealer. Mr. Boggs
could not collect his rent, and Amelia undertook to
do so. The clock-dealer had no money, but he
offered to pay his rent out of his stock-in-trade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took him up on that, for Pop was too easy,&rdquo;
explained Amelia, &ldquo;and I went through his shop,
looked at the price-tags, and picked out enough
clocks and watches to fill a wheelbarrow. My
brother Johnny wheeled &rsquo;em home. We sold some,<span class="pagenum">[145]</span>
and I expected to sell some of these I brought with
me. But the girls think it&rsquo;s such a joke I&rsquo;ll never
be able to get rid of &rsquo;em. Never mind. It only
makes &rsquo;em laugh, so where&rsquo;s the harm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That they laughed at her and her peculiarities,
did not bother Amelia. With Nan and her friends,
the girl from Wauhegan was happy; and if she did
not get along very fast in some of her studies, it was
not so serious a matter. Amelia was delighted to
get down into the kitchen (she had bribed the cook
with a clock) and there she concocted little dishes,
some of which found their way to Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s
table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; said the preceptress, laughing.
&ldquo;Amelia will have me start a course in domestic
science; and that is not what their parents have
sent these girls to my school for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, once enlisted in the cause of Nan&rsquo;s
banquet in the haunted boathouse, Amelia Boggs
became very helpful. It was she who borrowed
tablecloths and napkins from the cook for use at
the feast. Henry kept the door of the unused
part of the boathouse locked, only to be opened
when Nan and Bess and Amelia went there to make
final preparations for the banquet on the afternoon
of the day selected.</p>

<p>They laid the cloths, trimmed and filled the hanging
lamp, and laid the fire ready to light. Then the
key of the door was entrusted to Walter Mason<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
and he ran around into Freeling port in his motor
boat just before supper.</p>

<p>Nan thought Linda Riggs and Cora Courtney
had been lingering about the boathouse, listening
and peeping; but she did not suspect these girls, disagreeable
and objectionable as they were, would be
mean enough to tell any teacher about the proposed
banquet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose they are only wondering if we are to
have a finer spread than they will have at their
banquet,&rdquo; Nan said to Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just hate their snooping around so,&rdquo; grumbled
Bess.</p>

<p>Soon after supper Walter telephoned to his sister
from their own house that all was well. He
had delivered the goods at the boathouse and, with
the help of the Masons&rsquo; gardener, had carried everything
into the unused part of the building, as agreed.
The key had been left in a secret corner known only
to himself and Nan, and&mdash;he wished the girls good
luck!</p>

<p>Nan and her friends were all excitement that evening.
Not much preparation was made for the following
day&rsquo;s tasks. Had Mrs. Cupp not been very
busy about her own affairs, she would surely have
noticed that some of her charges were in a great
flutter.</p>

<p>Miss Sadie Vane, Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s sister, had come
to see her on this evening, and in great excitement<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
again. As soon as the matron was relieved of her
supper duties she put on her wraps and left for the
village with Miss Vane.</p>

<p>This relieved the minds of Nan and Bess not a
little. They ran down to the boathouse and found
the key. But Bess utterly refused to go in without
a light, and without the other girls for company.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said Nan. &ldquo;I guess everything
is safe. And all of the girls are so afraid of the
place after dark that if they could get in they would
not dare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The evening dragged by. Curfew rang and still
Mrs. Cupp did not return. Heavy-footed Susan
went up through the corridors and looked to the
lowering of the lights. Then she returned and the
older girls were left to themselves&mdash;supposedly for
the night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When the cat&rsquo;s away the mice can play.&rdquo; It
was then figures stole out of certain rooms, and
along the corridors, and down the stairs. A rear
door had been unchained. One by one the softly
flitting figures gathered in the back garden.</p>

<p>There was a wan moon to give them light enough
to find the way to the foot of the bluff. But it was
a ghostly moon, too, and aided objects along the
way in casting weird shadows. May Winslow clung
close to Nan and Bess. Grace and Lillie made up
the rest of the trembling group who looked to Nan
for comfort and support. Laura Polk and &ldquo;Procrastination<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
Boggs&rdquo; brought up a more or less
courageous rear. In between were girls in all stages
of excitement, from a state of hysterical fear to
equally hysterical laughter.</p>

<p>They came finally to the foot of the long flight of
steps and Nan marshalled her forces. &ldquo;Now, girls,
pluck up your spirits. Close ranks! Forward&mdash;march!&rdquo;
she commanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; quavered Lillie Nevin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; from Grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you sawneys!&rdquo; called the red-haired girl
from the rear. &ldquo;Behave! Don&rsquo;t try to give us all
a conniption fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded one of the other girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! are you seeing things, too?&rdquo; cried Amelia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. What kind of a fit is a &lsquo;conniption&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; admitted Laura. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve heard
my grandmother from New England speak familiarly
of &rsquo;em. What&rsquo;s the matter up front?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lil and Grace are balking,&rdquo; declared Nan,
with disgust. &ldquo;<i>Do</i> come on, children. I have an
electric lamp. We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be entirely in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I saw something,&rdquo; quavered the flaxen-haired
Lillie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Bess, more than a little inclined
herself to be panic-stricken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do come along!&rdquo; urged Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; squealed Grace, suddenly.</p>

<p>Half the girls thought they saw the black figure<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
dart around the corner of the building; the other
half were looking in an entirely different direction
at the moment. But all together emitted a chorused:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake, girls!&rdquo; gasped Nan. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ghost! the black ghost!&rdquo; quavered May
Winslow, groveling in the very depths of superstition.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>THERE IS A MYSTERY</small></h2>


<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a black dog!&rdquo; ejaculated Amelia Boggs. &ldquo;I
reckon there aren&rsquo;t any canine ghosts; are there,
Nan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The laugh which followed this sally broke the
spell of superstition that had clutched some of the
girls. Laughter drove away even the fears of May,
Lillie and Grace. Bess swallowed hard and laughed,
too; but she pinched Nan&rsquo;s arm as she whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was that black thing we saw before in the
boathouse, Nan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. Keep it to yourself,&rdquo; urged her
chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you two whispering about?&rdquo; complained
May. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t get us down here to try
to frighten us to death, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to give you all a good time, if
you&rsquo;ll let us,&rdquo; laughed Nan, cheerfully. &ldquo;Come on,
girls! If we spend so much time outside the boathouse,
somebody will be sure to see us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And think we&rsquo;re a whole troop of ghosts,&rdquo;
chuckled Laura Polk. &ldquo;Lead on, Macduff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not my middle name, but I&rsquo;ll lead,&rdquo; returned<span class="pagenum">[151]</span>
Nan promptly, and this time she succeeded
in reaching the side door of the boathouse. She
drew forth the electric flashlight and pointed it at
the lock, so she could see to insert the key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry up!&rdquo; cried Laura, from the rear. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
starved to death right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s only ten o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; somebody else said.
&ldquo;How can that be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t eat any supper,&rdquo; confessed the red-haired
girl, unblushingly. &ldquo;I knew Nan and Bess
would supply something better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s all here,&rdquo; Nan said, as the door swung
open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! don&rsquo;t suggest that any of those goodies
have been stolen!&rdquo; cried another girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe that black dog has been in the pantry,&rdquo;
chuckled Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No laughing matter,&rdquo; Laura said. &ldquo;Look quick,
Nancy, dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan entered in the lead. She flashed her spot
light about the big room. There was the row of
ice-cream tubs. One of them had its cover off and
some of the ice was scattered on the floor. On the
other side of the room were the hampers. The
covers had been wrenched off two of them and a
raid made upon the food they contained.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s been ahead of us?&rdquo; cried Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness&mdash;gracious&mdash;Agnes!&rdquo; murmured Amelia
Boggs.<span class="pagenum">[152]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t tell me you&rsquo;ve been robbed!&rdquo; was the
horrified cry of the red-haired girl.</p>

<p>Nan paid little attention to the rifled ice-cream
container. She hurried to the hampers. One had
been filled with individual salads, each in its paper
box. The other had held chicken and anchovy
sandwiches.</p>

<p>Several salad containers lay empty on the floor
and more had disappeared entirely&mdash;been carried
away by the thief, or thieves. At least a couple of
dozen sandwiches must have been abstracted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; wailed Bess, right at her chum&rsquo;s
shoulder. &ldquo;What an appetite!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For a ghost, I&mdash;should&mdash;say!&rdquo; agreed May
Winslow.</p>

<p>But Nan did not feel that the occasion was at all
funny. This was downright thievery. And she
felt quite sure that she knew who had done it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That mean, <i>mean</i> Linda Riggs!&rdquo; whispered Nan
to Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; breathed her chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who else could it be?&rdquo; returned Nan, with an
emphatic nod. But that was all she said at the
time. She hurried to light the big lamp and make
the girls welcome. At least the discovered raid on
the viands served to banish all fear of the boathouse
ghost. Ghosts certainly do not have an appetite
for chocolate ice-cream, tuna-fish salad, and
chicken sandwiches.<span class="pagenum">[153]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Start the fire&mdash;<i>do</i>, Amelia,&rdquo; begged Nan. &ldquo;Set
the plates and knives and forks, Bess. Make yourselves
at home, girls. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of starving,
Laura. There&rsquo;s <i>loads</i> to eat left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My mind is relieved by that assurance,&rdquo; said the
red-haired girl with a sigh.</p>

<p>Nan had seen to it that each window was curtained
and every crevice stopped, so that no light
could shine out and play traitor. But the fact that
the store of food had been raided disturbed her
mind not a little. If Linda Riggs and her chums
(for of course the conceited, self-assertive girl did
not make the raid alone), played one mean trick,
they might another. They might report to some
teacher or to Mrs. Cupp, what was going on in the
boathouse.</p>

<p>Nan began to realize now that this banquet giving
was rather a risky thing. The girls all did it, and it
was considered a forgivable offence against Dr.
Prescott&rsquo;s rules; but of course the principal desired
that the rule against eating after hours should be
obeyed, or else she would not have made the regulation.</p>

<p>Nan was rather sorry she had yielded to Bess
Harley&rsquo;s suggestion and arranged this banquet. But
now being given over heart and hand to the affair,
Nan did all she could to make the entertainment a
success.</p>

<p>At this distance from the Hall the girls felt free<span class="pagenum">[154]</span>
to let their tongues run, and to laugh and chatter to
their hearts&rsquo; content.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried May Winslow, &ldquo;this party is lots
nicer than any we ever had in our rooms, for here
we do not have to set a watch for Mrs. Cupp, or
be so careful how we breathe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only we should set a sentinel on guard against
ghosts, May,&rdquo; suggested Laura, wickedly. &ldquo;That
should be your job, honey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How mean of you!&rdquo; squealed May. &ldquo;I had all
but forgotten that horrid black thing we saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the ghost of some poor old slave your
grandfather owned, Winslow,&rdquo; said one girl. &ldquo;That
is, if it really is a black ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t haunt <i>me</i>,&rdquo; returned May, who
was from Alabama. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of any negro,
alive or dead! Grandfather Mullin was awfully
kind to all his people, and they all loved him. They
didn&rsquo;t feel themselves slaves. Our own forefathers
were held in bondage by the lords and barons over
in England, four or five hundred years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, say! don&rsquo;t start anything like that here,&rdquo;
begged Amelia. &ldquo;We get enough history I should
hope, from Mr. Bonner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right-oh!&rdquo; yawned Laura, lazily. &ldquo;Let good
fellowship flow with that cocoa that already smells
so good; and as we set to work upon the more
stable viands&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Hold on!&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;What are &lsquo;stable<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
viands&rsquo;? Oats and corn. One would think we were
horses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then Nan made the announcement: &ldquo;Ladies,
supper is served.&rdquo; And at that very moment, as the
girls crowded to the table and Amelia began to
pour the steaming drink, there came a resounding
knock upon the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ghost!&rdquo; gasped a number of the girls in
awed chorus.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it is,&rdquo; said Nan Sherwood, vigorously, as the
summons was repeated, &ldquo;he is in full possession of
his health and strength.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s something worse than a ghost,&rdquo; agreed
Laura Polk, grabbing several sandwiches and enveloping
them in the folds of her sweater. &ldquo;But I
vow I shall not be cheated out of all my supper.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>&ldquo;THE BLACK DOG&rdquo;</small></h2>


<p>Nobody started for the door for fully a minute,
and within that time the knocking was repeated
three times. It was not only an imperious rapping;
it was plainly inspired by some excitement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; Amelia Boggs murmured. &ldquo;That
ghost&rsquo;s in an awful hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s hungry, maybe,&rdquo; giggled one girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t be, if he ate all that he stole before we
got here,&rdquo; Bess declared.</p>

<p>Only Nan was silent. She suspected at once what
the commanding summons meant. It was a teacher,
perhaps Dr. Prescott herself. The party was a failure
and all the girls whom she had invited would,
with herself and chum, be punished for the frolic.</p>

<p>As she slowly approached the door, a voice from
outside faintly reached her ear: &ldquo;Let me in! open
the door!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan was astonished by this. It sounded like
somebody in distress. She hurriedly turned the
bolt and opened the door a little way. There was a
keen wind blowing off the water and the garments
of the person on the doorstep fluttered in it, so that<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
Nan knew at once it was a woman; but she could
not see her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; whispered Nan, while the other
truants held their breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, let me in, child!&rdquo; exclaimed
a vexed voice and the woman pushed by, slamming
the door when once she was inside. It did not need
the black veil jerked up over her hat to assure the
girls assembled that Mrs. Cupp was under the veil!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-<i>night!&rdquo;</i> murmured Laura, falling dramatically
into May Winslow&rsquo;s arms. &ldquo;&lsquo;All is lost!&rsquo;
the captain shouted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh-h!&rdquo; gasped the girl from Alabama. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
make her mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared the irrepressible. &ldquo;She
was born that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But suddenly Nan, as well as some of the other
girls, saw that the stern matron of Lakeview Hall
had been crying. Her cheeks were tear-stained
and she was still sobbing convulsively as she leaned,
exhausted, with her back against the door.</p>

<p>Nan was instantly sympathetic, and cried aloud:
&ldquo;What is the matter, Mrs. Cupp? What has happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m so frightened,&rdquo; stammered the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; whispered Lillie, shrilly. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s seen the
ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goodness!&rdquo; moaned May, almost letting the
red-haired girl fall to the floor.<span class="pagenum">[158]</span></p>

<p>But the latter, after all, was the one who rose to
the occasion. Even Nan was too amazed to appreciate
properly the fact that for once Mrs. Cupp was
in a melting mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give her a chair, Nan, do!&rdquo; cried Laura, bestirring
herself briskly. &ldquo;Something has surely
upset her. The poor dear! Wish we had a cup of
hot tea. But this chocolate is the next best thing
to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She poured a brimming cup and brought it to
Mrs. Cupp, who had been seated at the long table.
Before taking the first swallow the lady waved her
hand toward the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lock it!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is locked,&rdquo; Nan promptly assured her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can bet it is!&rdquo; exclaimed the crafty Laura.
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want anybody coming in here who will
<i>tell</i> on us,&rdquo; she added significantly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cupp must have heard this, for she flushed
as she drank the hot chocolate in great gulps. Or,
perhaps, it was only the color coming back into her
face, after her fright.</p>

<p>Nan asked, with real feeling: &ldquo;What was it
scared you so, Mrs. Cupp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; stammered the matron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it must have been something?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure even of that,&rdquo; was Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s
rather disconcerting reply.<span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the ghost, then!&rdquo; shrilled Lillie.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Grace, and the two timid ones
clung together in alarm and despair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, shucks!&rdquo; exclaimed Amelia Boggs. &ldquo;It
won&rsquo;t break the door down to get in here, so don&rsquo;t
be afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never was so frightened in my life,&rdquo; declared
Mrs. Cupp, drinking the last drop of the comforting
liquid. &ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do tell us all about it, Mrs. Cupp,&rdquo; urged the
red-haired girl, hovering about the excited lady.
&ldquo;And have another cup of chocolate; do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Cupp, with real gratitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, girls,&rdquo; said the bustling Laura. &ldquo;The
chocolate&rsquo;s all hot. Don&rsquo;t let it spoil. And the sandwiches
and salad must be eaten to be saved. Pull
up your chairs. Won&rsquo;t you try this lovely salad,
Mrs. Cupp? And these chicken sandwiches are
delicious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cupp was fairly caught. She had partaken
of the hospitality of the forbidden feast. Having
accepted the chocolate she made but weak protest
against the heartier viands. A delightfully arranged
plateful appeared like magic before her and
she found a fork in her hand.</p>

<p>Bess was almost bursting with suppressed laughter,
and even Nan had difficulty in keeping a straight<span class="pagenum">[160]</span>
face. Laura Polk had certainly stepped into the
breach. &ldquo;She deserves a leather medal,&rdquo; whispered
May Winslow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give her one of my clocks,&rdquo; promised
Amelia.</p>

<p>The girls gathered quietly about the long table
and the food began to disappear. Perhaps they were
not quite as hilarious as they expected to be at the
feast; but Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s presence did not make the
viands any the less delicious to the palate. And all
of the girls were anxious to hear the tale of the
matron&rsquo;s fright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What could it have been you saw?&rdquo; May asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. Something black,&rdquo; was the
sober reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O-o-o!&rdquo; from Grace and Lillie. &ldquo;<i>All</i> black?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did it look like a black dog?&rdquo; asked Nan, the
practical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare! it might have been,&rdquo; Mrs. Cupp said,
with some relief. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she added, with
sudden suspicion, &ldquo;you girls didn&rsquo;t have anybody
on watch outside?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. We were too scatterbrained for that,&rdquo;
laughed Laura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we did not think our light could be seen
through any crack,&rdquo; added Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Mrs. Cupp said promptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how did you know we were here, then?&rdquo;
blurted out Bess.<span class="pagenum">[161]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem! I knew. That is sufficient,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Cupp, more in her usual tone.</p>

<p>Then it was true. Nan knew that somebody had
played traitor. Mrs. Cupp had been told of the
party in the haunted boathouse by some jealous
girl, or she would never have come back to the Hall
from the village by the shore road. It was a
roundabout way, and lonely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The road was very dark,&rdquo; explained the still
excited matron. &ldquo;When I came to the big boulder
just the other side of the boat landing, something
sprang out of the bushes and chased me. It was
black, and looked like a man or boy, only it was on
four legs&mdash;or its hands and knees.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it was a dog,&rdquo; said Bess, doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The black dog Remorse,&rsquo; no less!&rdquo; whispered
Laura to Nan. &ldquo;It was the &lsquo;black dog&rsquo; of Mrs.
Cupp&rsquo;s conscience, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; returned Nan. She was worried by
the happening. The raid on their feast, the information
evidently lodged about their frolic with
Mrs. Cupp, and this &ldquo;black thing&rdquo; that had startled
them all, seemed to be all parts of a plot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it chased me!&rdquo; Mrs. Cupp went on. &ldquo;I
declare, I never was so frightened in all my life!
It chased me right to this door&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It really was lucky we were here, then, wasn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; put in Laura, to clinch the point.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cupp bit into a chicken sandwich, and<span class="pagenum">[162]</span>
frowned. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; she said
slowly. &ldquo;I never would have come back by the
shore road if I hadn&rsquo;t heard of what you girls were
doing here. I don&rsquo;t know but that I consider you
are the cause of my being so frightened,&rdquo; she concluded
grimly.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[163]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>PUNISHMENT</small></h2>


<p>Mrs. Cupp proved that she possessed a hearty
appetite, and that the fright she had suffered had
not impaired it. She accepted a second helping of
salad and two plates of ice-cream followed, with
several fancy cakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must say,&rdquo; she observed, in a more cordial
mood than any of the girls had ever seen her display
before. &ldquo;I must say that whoever chose these
refreshments showed more regard for your digestions
than usually is the case in such midnight
feasts. And as I remember my own schooldays, we
never had anything on such occasions that was
really fit for a girl to put in her stomach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Cupp!&rdquo; exclaimed Laura, &ldquo;did you
really have parties like this when you were a girl
at boarding school?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was just saying, Laura, that they were <i>not</i>
like this,&rdquo; returned the matron. &ldquo;But schoolgirls
are all alike, if banquets are not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girls giggled at that retort. It did seem<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
funny to hear Mrs. Cupp joke, in even the grimmest
manner.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Cupp was rapidly recovering from her
softer mood. Laura said afterward that if it took
a ghost-fright to make Mrs. Cupp &ldquo;livable,&rdquo; if the
matron were threatened with the guillotine, for
instance, she might really be good company while
the effect of the announcement of the coming tragedy
lasted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to know who the guilty party is,&rdquo; said
the Lakeview Hall matron. &ldquo;Who got up this party,
and who paid for it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the guilty one,&rdquo; said Nan, promptly. &ldquo;I
must be held solely responsible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, she is not alone responsible. I helped,&rdquo;
cried Bess, &ldquo;and if Nan is to be punished, I ought
to be, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so did I,&rdquo; Amelia put in. &ldquo;T&rsquo;won&rsquo;t be fair
for only one to be punished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you know,&rdquo; said the red-haired girl, with
saucy significance, &ldquo;we <i>all</i> helped eat Nan&rsquo;s lovely
supper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ahem! I see the point, Laura,&rdquo; Mrs. Cupp
observed. &ldquo;But it does not change the facts. A
rule of the Hall has been broken&mdash;flagrantly broken.
That you girls fled away to this spot for your
reprehensible act adds to the offence. We are
responsible to your parents and guardians for your
health and safety. The result of an escapade like<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
this nobody can foretell. Something might have
happened in this old boathouse to harm you girls
and bring ill-repute to the Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party of school-law breakers looked rather
solemn. Mrs. Cupp folded the napkin she had used
and brushed the crumbs from her black broadcloth
skirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing excuses an infraction of the rules. But
I am inclined to show leniency to everybody but the
prime mover in this affair. And that is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; gasped Bess Harley. &ldquo;Nan would never
have thought of having a supper but for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I chose this place for it, and it was my
money paid for it,&rdquo; cried Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much did it cost?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Cupp,
briskly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More than twenty-five dollars,&rdquo; confessed Nan,
blushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us! What extravagance!&rdquo; cried the
matron. &ldquo;You shall be punished for that, if for
nothing else, Nancy Sherwood,&rdquo; and she got up
quickly. &ldquo;Now, girls, is there anything left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some cream and cake, Mrs. Cupp,&rdquo; Amelia
promptly announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take it up to the Hall for Susan and the other
maids,&rdquo; ordered the matron. &ldquo;Miss Sherwood, Miss
Harley, Miss Polk and Miss Boggs may come down
here some time to-morrow and clean up. I will
speak to Dr. Prescott about the punishment to be<span class="pagenum">[166]</span>
meted out to the chief offender. She will be vexed
about it, I have no doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Laura sidled up to her as the matron prepared to
set forth with the truants for the Hall, and whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But wasn&rsquo;t that mayonnaise lovely, Mrs. Cupp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot cajole me, Miss Polk,&rdquo; the matron
said.</p>

<p>This speech gave the fun-makers a feeling of dejection.
Most of them did not know how clear Dr.
Prescott&rsquo;s sense of justice was. It looked as though
Nan Sherwood was in for a lot of trouble. And
she had given them such a delightful supper!</p>

<p>It so troubled their minds that even the timid
ones thought no more of &ldquo;the black dog&rdquo; as they
filed out of the boathouse. Nan locked the door,
and she and Mrs. Cupp came in the rear as the
whole party scuttled up the long flight of steps to
the brow of the bluff. Mrs. Cupp walked slowly
and leaned upon Nan&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know who that was out there in the
bushes, Nancy?&rdquo; the school matron asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Mrs. Cupp,&rdquo; declared Nan. &ldquo;Only I know
it couldn&rsquo;t be a ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about Grace Mason&rsquo;s brother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walter?&rdquo; cried Nan, in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. He helped you get those things over from
Ricolletti&rsquo;s, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[167]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es,&rdquo; admitted Nan. She feared that the
admission might get Walter into trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me like a boy&rsquo;s trick,&rdquo; Mrs. Cupp
said reflectively. &ldquo;I should have stopped to see who
it was at the time. But I <i>was</i> afraid. My sister
and I are in trouble enough as it stands, and I was
nervous, I suppose,&rdquo; she added, more to herself than
to Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sure, Mrs. Cupp, that Walter would
not frighten anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if he thought he could save you girls from
getting caught?&rdquo; asked the matron, shrewdly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am quite sure Walter was nowhere near the
boathouse at that time,&rdquo; Nan said, with confidence.
&ldquo;I know he telephoned to his sister this evening
from their house. Couldn&rsquo;t you call up his mother
or father, and find out if he went out again after
that time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea! I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cupp. &ldquo;You
report to Dr. Prescott to-morrow, after chapel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This order did not make Nan sleep any more
soundly that night. It was quite twelve o&rsquo;clock
when the girls separated under the sharp eye of
Mrs. Cupp, and scattered to their rooms. Bess
kissed Nan fondly before she crept into her own bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, Nancy!&rdquo; she breathed, &ldquo;we would
have had a lovely time if it hadn&rsquo;t been for old
Cupp!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And the one who set her after us,&rdquo; suggested
Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! who could she be? Linda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll never know, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; said Nan. &ldquo;I
thought at first Linda and her crowd had robbed
us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I guess whoever did that, scared Mrs. Cupp,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ghost?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. If you wish to call him that. But he is a
ghost with a big appetite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me! that&rsquo;s so, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; agreed Bess.
&ldquo;Well! I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;know&mdash;ow-oo!&rdquo; Yawn&mdash;sigh&mdash;murmur,
and Bess was off to the Land of Nod.</p>

<p>Not so Nan. She tossed about for a long time
ere she could find oblivion. Her conscience pricked
her, and a prickly conscience is just as unhappy a
bedfellow as a porcupine would be.</p>

<p>What would &ldquo;Momsey&rdquo; and &ldquo;Papa Sherwood&rdquo;
say if they heard of this escapade? Nan realized
that she had done wrong in yielding to the seductive
suggestion of the secret supper. She might
have given her girl friends a treat in some way that
would not have broken the school rules.</p>

<p>She was sorry, very sorry indeed, that she had
done this. More than a few tears wet Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s
pillow before she finally dropped asleep.
Nor had she found relief from this feeling of depression<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
the next morning, when she went alone to
Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s office.</p>

<p>This was the first time Nan had been sent to interview
the principal of Lakeview Hall for any such
reason. She had quite fallen in love with Dr. Beulah
Prescott on the evening of her arrival at the
school; and Nan Sherwood was of too truly an affectionate
disposition to hurt or offend anybody
whom she loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear, dear, Nancy Sherwood,&rdquo; said the principal,
in a worried way. &ldquo;I never expected to receive
such a report about you, of all my new girls.
Leader of a party of girls that steals out of the Hall
after bedtime, feasts on contraband eatables&mdash;Ahem!
where&rsquo;s the list of this &lsquo;forbidden fruit&rsquo;?
Here it is! Sandwiches, salad, cake, chocolate and
coffee, ice-cream. Dear me! dear me! what will
your digestions be like if you keep on in this
way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Dr. Prescott,&rdquo; Nan said faintly, as
the preceptress halted for breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see no pickles, olives or cheese on the bill-of-fare,&rdquo;
said the doctor, lowering her lorgnette.
&ldquo;How is that? A schoolgirl picnic without those
delectables?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My&mdash;my money didn&rsquo;t hold out,&rdquo; confessed
Nan, her eyes suddenly dancing. Dr. Prescott was
not proving so difficult, after all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Cupp reports only you for punishment,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
said the principal, after a momentary smile. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you think the others deserve punishment, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Dr. Prescott,&rdquo; Nan was prompt to say. &ldquo;It
wouldn&rsquo;t have happened, and the other girls would
not have been down there at the boathouse, if it
hadn&rsquo;t been for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, possibly that may be so. That was Mrs.
Cupp&rsquo;s opinion, and we will let it rest at that. Also,
Mrs. Cupp recommended you to mercy, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This surprised Nan a good deal. She had not
thought the stern matron was given at all to mercy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, we must show our disapproval of
such reprehensible actions,&rdquo; continued Dr. Prescott.
&ldquo;You are sentenced to solitary recreation hours for
a week. On your honor, remember. No conversation
with the other girls, save in study and recitation
hours, until a week from to-day. Remember!
Not even with Miss Harley. That is all, Nancy.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[171]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>A STRANGE ADVENTURE</small></h2>


<p>It really seemed awfully funny.</p>

<p>Nan went about with sealed lips save when she
had to ask a question of a neighbor in study hour
or in class. Even in Room Seven, Corridor Four,
there was silence. Bess was at first amused, then
disgusted, then indignant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why! whoever heard the like?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Not
to speak? Goodness! Why, I never had so many
things to say to you in my life before, and you sit
as dumb as one of those Japanese monkeys,&rdquo; and
she pointed to the tiny &ldquo;Hear No Evil, See No
Evil, Speak No Evil&rdquo; group on Nan&rsquo;s bookshelf.</p>

<p>At first Nan only smiled at her chum&rsquo;s impatience.
But soon she found it necessary to steal off by herself
during recreation time. The temptation to
speak was too great.</p>

<p>Nor did Bess try to make it easier for Nan to
keep strictly to the line of punishment that had
been inflicted upon her by Dr. Beulah Prescott.
Bess began to take a wicked delight in catching her
off her guard and getting a word past Nan&rsquo;s lips
before she thought.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh bah!&rdquo; cried the careless Bess. &ldquo;What does<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
it matter? We&rsquo;re in our own room. Dr. Beulah
knows very well you won&rsquo;t stick to the very letter
of her command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan felt differently about it. The principal had
trusted her to keep her lips sealed during recreation
hours; and she tried as much as possible to keep
by herself. &ldquo;Solitary recreation hours for a week.&rdquo;
That was Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s command and Nan did
her best to keep away from her fellow-pupils. One
afternoon, between her last recitation for the day
and suppertime, she went down to Mrs. Cupp with
her arms full of summer clothing, for permission to
put the frocks away in her trunk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s your key and the key to the trunk-room.
I trust the latter to you, Nancy, because I see you
are a girl of honor,&rdquo; Mrs. Cupp said, rather kindly
for her. &ldquo;I see you are trying to obey the doctor&rsquo;s
instructions regarding your recreation time. You
may stay down there till the supper bell rings, if
you like. But remember, if you wish to bring anything
up with you from your trunk, you must show
it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes Mrs. Cupp,&rdquo; replied Nan, soberly.</p>

<p>This was not the first time she had asked permission
to go to her trunk. And she had always chosen
a time when no other girls were around, and she
could be alone in the trunk-room. She went down
stairs rather thoughtfully now. Mrs. Cupp believed
she was a girl of honor. Nan was wondering<span class="pagenum">[173]</span>
if, after all, she came up to the requirements
for such a person?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not being entirely truthful right now,&rdquo; she
thought. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to go down cellar with these
things. I have plenty of room for them in my
clothes closet. I am going to my trunk for an
entirely different reason.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; pursued Nan Sherwood, reflectively,
&ldquo;if all girls are like that? Are we naturally untruthful
about little things? Do I know a perfectly
frank girl in all this school? Goodness! nobody
but poor Amelia Boggs, and she is half-cracked,
the other girls say.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I like Walter,&rdquo; declared Nan, to
herself. &ldquo;I guess that is why I like Cousin Tom&mdash;and
even Rafe. It&rsquo;s sometimes ugly to speak the
brutal truth, I know. But it is never dishonorable.
Now am I deliberately acting deceitfully because I
did not tell Mrs. Cupp <i>all</i> my reason for coming
down here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such abstract questions as this often troubled
Nan Sherwood. She never discussed them with her
chum, or with anybody else, now. But she often
wished she could talk them over with her mother,
as she used to do. &ldquo;Momsey&rdquo; always saw everything
so clearly, and always knew just the right
and wrong of things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s so hard sometimes,&rdquo; Nan murmured,
&ldquo;to tell what is right and what is wrong!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[174]</span></p>

<p>She snapped on the electric light nearest to her
trunk. The receptacles were in rows, each with a
card on which the owner&rsquo;s name was clearly written.
Nan&rsquo;s was in a corner at the end of the main
building nearest the unfinished part. She had come
down a passage from the stairway to get to the
trunk-room. This part of the cellar was a long way
from the kitchen and scullery.</p>

<p>Some of the girls were afraid to come to the
trunk-room alone, although their imagination had
not yet peopled this part of the Hall with ghosts.
Nan thought of nothing, when she had raised the lid
of her trunk, but one thing. She carefully put
aside the empty trays and the layers of clothing
hiding the long box at the bottom of the trunk.</p>

<p>It was locked with a little brass padlock. Tom
Sherwood had made the box very neatly and
nobody could possibly open the receptacle without
the key, unless the box were broken. Nan wore the
tiny key in a little leather bag, on a chain of fine
gold links which had been her mother&rsquo;s when she
was a little girl in Memphis.</p>

<p>Nan quickly unlocked the box and raised the
cover. A rush of sweet smelling herb-odors burst
forth. It was the combined odor of the tamarack
swamp of upper Michigan (or so it seemed), where
Nan had spent the past summer. She lifted aside
the covering of tissue paper, and revealed a great,
pink-cheeked, blue-eyed, beautiful doll!<span class="pagenum">[175]</span></p>

<p>It was as large as a real baby, and it was dressed
elegantly. Nan&rsquo;s mother, with her own frail hands,
had made all the garments &ldquo;Beautiful Beulah&rdquo; wore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Beulah, <i>dear!&rdquo;</i> murmured Nan, hugging the doll
up tight to her bosom and rocking herself to and
fro as she sat upon the floor. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just like going
home again, to see you. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to see
our dear little room in the &lsquo;dwelling in amity&rsquo;? If
only we could fly back there, really! Only for just
an hour! And have Momsey and Papa Sherwood
at home, too, and all be together again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan choked up at this and the tears began to
flow. But she crowded them back in a moment.
&ldquo;Oh! this will never do&mdash;this will never do,&rdquo; she
cried, under her breath. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll only make you feel
bad, too, my dear, darling Beautiful Beulah. And,
goodness me!&rdquo; added Nan Sherwood, suddenly becoming
practical, &ldquo;what would Dr. Beulah think
if she heard me? She would perhaps think I had
named you after her. I&rsquo;m not sure that a principal
of a great school like this would want to be godmother
to a doll.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! I guess that&rsquo;s why I love her so
much&mdash;because she bears the same name as you, my
dear. And you&rsquo;d love her, too, if you could know
her. Oh, dear! I wonder if I did wrong in hiding
you down here in the bottom of my trunk? Mrs.
Cupp certainly wouldn&rsquo;t have taken you away from
me. The girls might have made fun, and Bess, I<span class="pagenum">[176]</span>
s&rsquo;pose, would have been difficult. But I&rsquo;d have felt
better to have you up stairs in Number Seven, Corridor
Four&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>A step in the passage outside the open trunk-room
door! Nan rose up in a panic, clutching
Beulah to her breast. Somebody was coming.</p>

<p>There was not time to put the doll back into
her nest and successfully hide her. The wall at the
end of the cellar was of heavy planking. A pile of
empty dry-goods cases stood at hand, a narrow
alley having been left between the tiers of boxes
and the plank wall.</p>

<p>Nan darted behind this screen of boxes, the doll
in her arms. She slipped on something in the dark
passage and was flung with considerable force
against the plank partition. To her amazement and
alarm, a narrow section of the partition moved out,
dropping downward and outward from the top, as
though it were hinged at the bottom.</p>

<p>This narrow door was weighted, so it could not
fall abruptly. Nan was flung sprawling upon it,
and lay there with her doll, as the shutter dropped
quietly to a horizontal position.</p>

<p>She knew she lay over some deep cistern, or the
like, and that the plank door bridged it. It was
pitch-dark behind the partition and a sour, damp
smell, like the odor of an old brewing cellar, rose
to her nostrils. Nan Sherwood, startled as she was,
uttered no outcry.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[177]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>AN UNEXPECTED MISFORTUNE</small></h2>


<p>As Nan lay on the secret drawbridge, she heard
a stealthy footstep on the cement floor of the trunk-room.
The step was light, and, plainly, there was
but one person approaching. It must be one of the
girls. Certainly it could not be Mrs. Cupp, for she
was heavy-footed. Nan wished she had not been
so foolish as to run, for she was really frightened
because of her position over the old cistern. If
the intruder was only one of the other girls, coming
to open a trunk, she could easily have hidden the
doll behind the boxes and waited until the girl had
gone up stairs again before putting Beautiful Beulah
properly away in her nest.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Nan sat up and began to creep
off the dropped door. As her weight was gradually
removed from it, the weights began to raise the
door into its usual position. There must have been
some secret fastening to hold the door shut, that
was broken when Nan&rsquo;s weight was cast against
the plank wall.</p>

<p>Her fall had been just at the right place to start
the door swinging downward. Now, when she<span class="pagenum">[178]</span>
carefully stepped away from the partition, having
risen to her full height, the secret door swung up
and closed tightly. She could not feel its edge on
either side with her fingers.</p>

<p>But that was not what she was most interested in
just then. The secret door puzzled her, but the step
in the cellar impressed Nan as being of more importance.
She peered around the tiers of boxes to
see the other girl.</p>

<p>It was Linda Riggs.</p>

<p>The trunks belonging to those girls whose names
began with &ldquo;R&rdquo; were right next to those whose
owners&rsquo; names commenced with &ldquo;S.&rdquo; The electric
bulb near Nan&rsquo;s trunk gave Linda light enough for
her purpose. Nan saw her take a key from her
purse and open her trunk with it.</p>

<p>That would not have been surprising, only for the
fact that the key had no tag attached to it, such as
Mrs. Cupp fastened to all the trunk keys left in her
charge. Nan saw that Linda watched the door of
the trunk-room sharply as she rummaged to the
bottom of her trunk. The girl was evidently down
here without Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s knowledge, and was
afraid of being caught.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another key!&rdquo; Nan whispered to herself.
&ldquo;Why! she owns two and Mrs. Cupp doesn&rsquo;t know
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She watched Linda without saying a word.<span class="pagenum">[179]</span>
Linda, on the other hand, paid no attention to Nan&rsquo;s
open trunk. Seeing no other girl about, probably
led her to believe that whoever had been in the
trunk-room ahead of her had carelessly gone out,
leaving her trunk open, and the door open and the
lamp lit, as well.</p>

<p>Linda soon obtained the article she desired&mdash;a
small, flat parcel&mdash;and with this, after relocking her
trunk, she went away. Nan was curious enough to
watch to see how Linda went up stairs. Surely
she had not come down past Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s open
door.</p>

<p>That suspicion was verified when Nan saw Linda
turn into the passage leading to the kitchen. It was
an hour in the afternoon when one might pass up
the kitchen stairs without being observed by the
busy women preparing supper. Besides, as Linda
was always giving presents to the servants, they
might be conveniently blind to her movements. Nan
went back with Beulah and put her carefully away
in the box at the bottom of the trunk. The mystery
of the secret door was overshadowed in her
mind by the actions of Linda Riggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;re all deceivers,&rdquo; Nan considered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m deceitful myself. And Linda Riggs is positively
dishonorable. Mrs. Cupp would be very
angry if she knew Linda was down here without
permission and had a private key to her trunk.<span class="pagenum">[180]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And all we girls seem to be just delighted to
break the rules, or try to fool the teachers. It really
is dreadful! I guess we all must think that rules
are made only to be broken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! perhaps if there were no laws none of
us would care to go wrong,&rdquo; concluded Nan, perhaps
striking the key-note of all human frailty.</p>

<p>She went rather soberly up stairs and delivered
her own trunk-key and the door-key to the matron,
who she was glad asked her no questions. The
afternoon mail had just arrived. May Winslow
was acting as postmistress for the week, and the
girls were crowding about the office table on which
May had sorted the letters.</p>

<p>Either Dr. Prescott or Mrs. Cupp had run
through the mail first. Letters from home were
never held up. Suspicious looking letters had to
be opened in the matron&rsquo;s presence. Nan&rsquo;s only
missive this day was an unexpected one from Scotland.</p>

<p>She had grown to know just how the foreign
mails were carried and when to look for a letter
bearing the Emberon postmark. Somehow, this
unexpected epistle frightened Nan.</p>

<p>She hurried up to Room Seven, Corridor Four, to
read the letter alone. Her chum was not there
and for once Nan was glad of that. Sitting by
the window where the light was fading, Nan opened
her letter.<span class="pagenum">[181]</span></p>

<p class="tb">&ldquo;My dearest child:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since writing you day-before-yesterday, we
have received quite a shock. Your dear father is
in such a state of mind that he cannot write to you
about it. I am calm myself, dearest Nan, because
I know that our Heavenly Father will not see us
troubled more greatly than we can bear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have, all the time, had perfect confidence in
the final adjustment of Mr. Hughie Blake&rsquo;s estate
and the establishment of our clear title to it. It
seemed as though this already was a fact. But a
new difficulty has arisen. Just as Mr. Andrew
Blake was about to take possession of the property
in our name, a court order restrained him. A new
branch of the family, at least, a newly discovered
claimant by the name of Blake, has appeared. There
are two sisters, maiden ladies, who claim that their
mother was married to a man named Hugh Blake,
who afterward separated from her. They have only
recently found their mother&rsquo;s marriage lines and
their own birth certificates, proving the marriage
and their own title to any property of which their
father may have died possessed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Andrew Blake pooh-poohs this claim as he
did the others. He is positive that Mr. Hughie
Blake was never married. He was, in fact, notoriously
a woman-hater. But while the Laird of Emberon
was on his Continental travels many years
ago, his steward, Hughie Blake, was for two years<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>
away from Castle Emberon. These two years correspond
with the years in which these Blake sisters
claim their father lived with their mother in a
North of England shire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the story, dear Nan, the details of which
will not interest you much, only as they affect our
financial situation. We are greatly in Mr. Andrew
Blake&rsquo;s debt at the present time. Your father is
writing by this mail to the lawyer in Tillbury to
raise money on our little home by a mortgage to pay
these debts and to pay your school bills for the remainder
of the year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This holding up of our fortune is only temporary,
I am sure. I am trusting in our Father&rsquo;s goodness
still. I will not be alarmed. But the delay
worries your poor papa very much. Our friends
here are very kind to us, and Mr. Andrew Blake
urges us to accept his financial aid again; but
Papa Sherwood can be, you know, the most stubborn
of men when he wants to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">There was more of the letter&mdash;intimate, tender
passages that Nan could have shown to nobody.
Her mother&rsquo;s heart was opened wide to the girl, as
it always was when they were together. &ldquo;Momsey&rdquo;
and she had been much more intimate than mothers
and little daughters usually are. Mrs. Sherwood
now confided in Nan as she would have done had
they been at home together.<span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>The hour darkened, and Nan could no longer see
to read as she sat by the window. She put the
letter away and bathed her eyes and face before
turning on the light.</p>

<p>In fact, she was still in the dark when Bess came
romping in. Nan seemed no more quiet to Bess
than she had for several days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I declare!&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just as soon room
with a funeral mute, as with a girl who won&rsquo;t talk.
You&rsquo;re the limit, Nan Sherwood!&rdquo; and she went off
to join some of the girls who were under no ban
of silence.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[184]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>RUMOR BLOWS ABOUT</small></h2>


<p>Bess Harley was not at all a heartless girl; and
she really loved Nan devotedly. But she could not
understand just why her chum was so particular in
her honorable observance of the sentence of silence.
Nor did she know anything about the very upsetting
letter Nan had received from Scotland. Finding
Nan far from gay on this particular evening, and
being fond of bustle and excitement herself, Bess
deserted Number Seven, Corridor Four, and found
amusement in the companionship of other girls who
could talk.</p>

<p>Nan was unhappy; yet she was glad to be left to
herself. She faithfully prepared her tasks for the
next day, and then put out the light and sat by the
window, looking out into the starlit night.</p>

<p>From her window she had an unobstructed view
of the top of the flight of steps leading to the
shore, as well as the blinking light on the point
and the many windows of a lake steamer going
past.</p>

<p>Of late the water had grown too cold for swimming,
and boating was not so popular as it had<span class="pagenum">[185]</span>
been. The keen winds sometimes blew over the
lake and into the school cove, foretelling the winter
which was steadily approaching from the Canadian
side.</p>

<p>Besides, as the term progressed, the school tasks
for the girls became more arduous. Dr. Prescott
began the year cautiously; but when she once had
her girls &ldquo;into their stride,&rdquo; as she called it, she
pushed them hard. There was less and less time
for sport and recreation for those girls who desired
to stand well in the monthly reports sent home
to parents or guardians.</p>

<p>Girls like Linda Riggs and most of her friends,
did not seem to care what their reports were. But
Nan felt differently; and even careless Bess had
ambition to please the folks at home.</p>

<p>As Nan sat at the window on this evening, however,
she wondered if it greatly mattered, after all,
what she did&mdash;whether she studied, or not. For
the letter from Scotland had made the girl very
hopeless, indeed. She could not, for this once, at
least, feel the uplift of &ldquo;Momsey&rsquo;s&rdquo; hopeful nature.
She feared that the fortune which, like a
will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, had danced before their eyes for
so many months, was now about to disappear in a
Morass of Despair. The little &ldquo;dwelling in amity&rdquo;
mortgaged! That seemed to Nan a most terrible
thing.</p>

<p>And &ldquo;Papa Sherwood&rdquo; and &ldquo;Momsey&rdquo; would<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
have to come home, and &ldquo;Papa Sherwood&rdquo; would
have to take up the search for work again which
had so clouded their lives during the first weeks of
this very year.</p>

<p>With the outlook on life of a much older person,
Nan saw all these approaching difficulties, and they
loomed up mountain high in her imagination. After
the joy of believing poverty was banished forever
from their lives, it seemed to be marching upon
them with a more horrid mien than ever.</p>

<p>All the money that could possibly be raised upon
the cottage on Amity Street would barely bring her
parents home and pay the remainder of her year&rsquo;s
tuition at Lakeview Hall. Nan knew how much
the latter would be, and there rose in her heart a
determination. It would be impossible to get any
of the half year&rsquo;s tuition money back&mdash;that which
had been already paid; but her father would not
have to pay the remainder of the fee if she left
school at the mid-winter holidays.</p>

<p>And this would she do. &ldquo;Papa Sherwood&rdquo;
should not be troubled by that expense! If she only
had not recklessly expended that whole five-pound
note for the spread in the haunted boathouse!</p>

<p>Over spilled milk, however, there was little use to
cry. Extravagances must stop right here and now.</p>

<p>By and by Nan slipped out of her clothes, braided
her hair in the dark, and got into bed long before
the retiring bell rang. When Bess came in, her<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
chum made a pretense of being asleep, and in her
heart thought: &ldquo;More deceit!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Nan felt she could not listen to Bess&rsquo; chatter
on this night.</p>

<p>She arose early in the morning, after an uneasy
night, and while the steam was knocking its usual
morning tattoo in the radiators (the girls said Mrs.
Cupp never reported that annoyance to the engineer,
for it served to make even the &ldquo;lazybones&rdquo; of the
school rise promptly) Nan sat by the window,
through which the cold light stole, and began a
reply to her mother&rsquo;s letter. She had written a
page and a half when the gong sounded and Bess
sleepily crept out of bed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hul-lo!&rdquo; Bess yawned.</p>

<p>Nan could merely nod to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, gracious goodness me!&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;This
is the last day you&rsquo;ve got to keep your mouth
closed, I should hope! I never did see such a stubborn
girl in my life before! If I had been as dumb
as you have been this week, I know I should never
be able to speak again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan smiled at this; though to tell the truth, even
that was hard work. To leave beautiful Lakeview
Hall, and all the girls whom she loved, and the
teachers, including Dr. Beulah and Professor Krenner!</p>

<p>Tears blinded her eyes. She could no longer
see to write. She did not want to stain the pages<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>
with tears, for then &ldquo;Momsey&rdquo; would know just
how bad she really felt. She jumped up, bathed
her eyes with cold water, and finished her own
toilet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look just as though you had hay-fever,
Nan,&rdquo; Bess grumbled. &ldquo;But as you can&rsquo;t have that
at this time of year, I believe you have been crying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her chum did not admit this by either word or
look. She put on her cap and coat and ran out
for some exercise before breakfast. Bess never
indulged in such a thing. She always dressed so
slowly that she did not have time for a walk or a
run before the breakfast bell sounded.</p>

<p>She did, on this morning, however, think to open
the window before she left Room Seven, and left
the corridor door open, too. Immediately a draft
of air sucked through the room and blew Nan&rsquo;s uncompleted
letter to her mother out of doors. The
result of this mischance was more important than
one would have thought.</p>

<p>In the first place, Cora Courtney chanced to be
walking briskly in the snowy garden. The thin
white coverlet that had shrouded the walks and
lawn overnight, crisped under her footsteps as she
tramped along. Down fluttered Nan&rsquo;s unfinished
letter right in Cora&rsquo;s path. Of course, Cora picked
it up and it was only natural that she should look
at it to see what it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! Can this be <i>so?&rdquo;</i> murmured Cora,<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
after a glance down the written lines on the first
page. &ldquo;Oh! Dear me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was not a hard-hearted girl at all. And Nan
Sherwood had never done any wrong to Cora, or
said anything to her that was not kindly. Cora
had no reason whatsoever for wishing the girl from
Tillbury ill. So, naturally, she was sorry to learn
that such serious trouble had come upon her schoolmate.</p>

<p>Under other influences than those that had shaped
her course ever since she had come to Lakeview
Hall, Cora would have been a very different girl.
Her people were really very poor. Her father was
addicted to drink and his family suffered thereby.
Her mother had come of a well-to-do family; but
her relatives had almost all turned against her when
she married Mr. Courtney.</p>

<p>One aunt, however, remembered the oldest of
the Courtney children, and offered to educate Cora.
Instead of sending the girl to a school where she
would have been quickly and efficiently trained to
earn her own living, the foolish aunt sent her to
this exclusive finishing school for young ladies.</p>

<p>Every one about her had more money than poor
Cora Courtney. Her clothing was barely sufficient.
Dr. Prescott, out of her own pocket, delicately supplied
the poor girl with some absolute necessities.</p>

<p>Thus feeling the nip of poverty all the time, Cora
was easily tempted to join the clique of parasites<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
who gathered around the free-handed, but unpleasant,
Linda Riggs. They all toadied to Linda, ran
errands for her, and as Laura Polk tartly said,
&ldquo;performed all the duties of the Roman populace as
Linda, as a female Csar, demanded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Now Cora was immediately moved to pity by
what she had discovered in Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s unfinished
letter. She could appreciate the sting of
poverty, and knew how she should feel herself if
her great aunt abruptly cut off the tuition fees. And
in this case Nan seemed to be giving up all from
a sense of duty.</p>

<p>Her heart told Cora to run to Nan with the
letter and tell her how sorry she was; but her
head advised her to take an entirely different course.
And Cora had learned to let her head guide her,
and not her heart.</p>

<p>There was still time before breakfast, and Cora
hurried up to the room which she shared with Linda.
It was in an entirely different part of the building
from that where Nan and Bess lodged, and was
a larger and much better-furnished apartment, with
a private bath attached, put in at Mr. Riggs&rsquo; cost
for his daughter. Cora Courtney was considered
very lucky by their special clique to be Linda&rsquo;s
roommate, and she did not mind playing maid to
the haughty Linda for the privilege of sharing in
the luxuries of the apartment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Linda! Look what I&rsquo;ve found!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[191]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what it is!&rdquo; snarled the purse-proud
girl, as she stood before the mirror. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make
my hair come right. It&rsquo;s all in a tangle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was sleepy and cross, and her scanty brown
hair was in a snarl. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to help me, Cora,&rdquo;
she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to get up when the gong strikes;
then you wouldn&rsquo;t have to be helped,&rdquo; said Cora,
who wanted to shirk an unpleasant service if she
could.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I got up at five o&rsquo;clock it wouldn&rsquo;t be any
better,&rdquo; whined Linda. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always in a snarl!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you braid it nicely when you
go to bed? You fall right into bed with your hair
in a regular rat&rsquo;s nest!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so-o tired then,&rdquo; yawned Linda. &ldquo;Come! be
a friend and help me. I should think you would.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! I don&rsquo;t like to fix hair any better
than you do,&rdquo; snapped Cora, coming unwillingly
to the task.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on and be a good child,&rdquo; said Linda, more
cajoling than usual. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you that
coral necklace of mine to wear to the Grand Guard
Ball tomorrow night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Linda! are you truly?&rdquo; gasped Cora, seizing
the hairbrush with avidity at this promise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. I know you like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you won&rsquo;t have any necklace to wear yourself!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[192]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I will. Don&rsquo;t fear,&rdquo; said Linda, looking
very shrewd and nodding emphatically.</p>

<p>Cora stood aside and looked at her closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; she gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind what I mean, Miss,&rdquo; replied Linda,
shortly. &ldquo;You go on with your work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never mean to wear that beautiful necklace
of your grandmother&rsquo;s?&rdquo; Cora amazedly inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t I just?&rdquo; returned Linda, tossing her head.
&ldquo;Ouch!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t pull, then,&rdquo; said Cora calmly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! you&rsquo;re awfully mean!&rdquo; cried Linda, tears
in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just fooling. You couldn&rsquo;t get the necklace
without Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s knowing it, and you know
very well she declared last term that no girl should
wear such an expensive thing at Lakeview Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you bother, Miss. Mrs. Cupp isn&rsquo;t omnipotent,&rdquo;
said Linda, more placidly. &ldquo;And the
Grand Guard Ball is not held at the Hall, thank
goodness! You shall wear the coral necklace. It
looks pretty next to the black lace in the neck of
your gown. And it shall be yours to keep if you&rsquo;re
a good girl. Now! what&rsquo;s all this you tried to tell
me when you came in? I&rsquo;m awake now,&rdquo; said
Linda, luxuriating under Cora&rsquo;s deft hands.</p>

<p>Cora thrust the unfinished letter which she had
found before Linda&rsquo;s eyes.<span class="pagenum">[193]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s writing!&rdquo; gasped Linda, pouncing
on it at once. She read aloud:</p>

<p class="tb">&ldquo;Dearest Momsey:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love you! love you! And I wish I were where
you are, or you were where I am. I&rsquo;d love to let
down your beautiful hair and brush it and make it
all pretty again, as I used. I am so, <i>so</i> lonely for
you and Papa Sherwood that I don&rsquo;t so much mind
if you don&rsquo;t ever get any of that money and have to
come home, and we are poor again in &lsquo;the little
dwelling in amity.&rsquo; I so very much want to see you
both that I hope you will come back from Scotland
right away and we shall meet in dear old Tillbury
and not have to be separated any more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am thankful to you and Papa Sherwood for
sending me to this nice school; and I enjoy it, and
if everything were all right, I&rsquo;d dearly love to stay.
But I am so <i>hungry</i> for a sight of you that I&rsquo;ll
gladly give up school.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that is just what I must do, dear Momsey,
and you must make Papa Sherwood agree. I won&rsquo;t
let him spend any of that money he will have to
raise on mortgage to pay the other half year&rsquo;s fees
here. No, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="tb">The letter ended there. Had Cora not been so
much under Linda&rsquo;s influence she would have cried
a bit over the tender lines Nan had written.<span class="pagenum">[194]</span></p>

<p>But Linda fairly exulted over the information
which the letter gave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that great,&rdquo; she demanded excitedly.
&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll fix that Nan Sherwood! Got to leave,
and her folks aren&rsquo;t going to be rich, after all! I
don&rsquo;t suppose there was ever any chance of it, anyway.
It was just talk. Ha! the nasty little thing.
This will just fix her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Nan, all that last day of silence, went about
wondering why many of the girls looked so oddly
at her, and especially Linda Riggs&rsquo; group. They
laughed, and made supposedly funny speeches
which were evidently aimed at Nan, but which she
did not understand.</p>

<p>Rumor was blowing about, and before Bess Harley
had any of the particulars from her chum of the
calamity that had befallen, the whole school practically
knew that Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s folks &ldquo;were poor
as church mice.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[195]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>THE GRAND GUARD BALL</small></h2>


<p>Bess was in a terrible state of mind when the
news was told to her. She told Nan before suppertime
that the girls were saying awful things, and
she wanted to know what it meant. The fact that
Nan was still bound by Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s sentence of
silence made no difference to Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to tell me what it means, or I&rsquo;ll never
speak to you again, so there!&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;How
is it your own chum never knows anything about
your secrets, and other girls do? It&rsquo;s a horrid
shame!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan, much troubled herself now, having discovered
the loss of her unfinished letter, ran off to
the principal and begged to be relieved of her sentence
of silence. &ldquo;Else I shall lose my dearest
friend!&rdquo; she told Dr. Prescott, quite wildly. &ldquo;Something
has happened that I <i>must</i> tell her about, dear
Dr. Prescott! I <i>must!&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Must&rsquo; is a hard master, Nancy,&rdquo; said the principal,
softly. &ldquo;Are you in trouble?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dr. Prescott,&rdquo; admitted Nan, almost sobbing.<span class="pagenum">[196]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Can I help you at all, my dear?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! Oh, thank you, no! Oh! it&rsquo;s nothing to
do with my own self here at school; but it is about
my father and my mother. They&mdash;they are having
some trouble in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see, my dear,&rdquo; said Dr. Prescott, quietly. &ldquo;I
hope it is not as bad as you evidently think. But,
whatever it is, remember that I am always ready to
help my girls if I can. There may be something
later that I can do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you! thank you, so much, Dr. Prescott!&rdquo;
Nan cried, putting up her lips for the warm kiss
the preceptress gave her. &ldquo;And I may speak to
Bess?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I absolve you from further silence. I think you
will remember this punishment,&rdquo; said the principal,
with a smile.</p>

<p>Then Nan went back and told Bess all. The
two girls read Mrs. Sherwood&rsquo;s letter again and
again, and Bess declared that Nan should not leave
Lakeview Hall, no matter what happened about the
Scotch legacy. &ldquo;My father will pay for you to
stay here with me, Nan Sherwood. You know he
will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan would not argue this point. They had talked
that over to a conclusion long before circumstances
had made it possible for Nan to attend the school.
With all her desire for an education, Nan was the
soul of independence. She knew now just what<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
she would do. Her parents could not get home
much before the Christmas holidays, and Nan determined
to go to Tillbury to them when they
reached there, and at once get a certificate from Mr.
Mangel, the high-school principal, and try to secure
a position in some store in Tillbury. She told
Bess, to that young lady&rsquo;s disgust and alarm, that
she must help support the family and help her father
pay off the mortgage that would have to be put on
the little cottage on Amity Street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s just as mean as it can be!&rdquo; sobbed
Bess, fairly given up to woe. &ldquo;And we were going
to have such fun this winter. And Dad&rsquo;s almost
promised that we should have a nice boat next
spring. Oh, dear me, Nan Sherwood! Something
always is happening to you to stir us all up!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At another time Nan would have laughed at this
way of expressing it; but she found no food for
laughter in anything now. The girls who were
closest to her, and loved her, were just as tender
and kind as their several natures suggested. Grace
Mason cried outright and her eyes were swollen
and red the next morning when Walter ran over in
the motor car to see her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Sis?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
been picking on you now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh! Nobody. Nan and Bess and Laura wouldn&rsquo;t
let them,&rdquo; his sister confessed. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s Nan&mdash;in
<i>such</i> trouble!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>She related what she knew of the circumstances,
and Walter was deeply impressed by the story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead and get Nan, and we&rsquo;ll take a little
spin,&rdquo; suggested the boy.</p>

<p>While his sister ran to ask permission, and to find
Nan, Linda Riggs came along and stopped, as always,
to speak to Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is it you never take us girls to ride any
more, as you used to last term?&rdquo; asked the rich girl,
smiling winningly on Walter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t have much time,&rdquo; stammered the boy,
awkwardly. &ldquo;Tutors, you know, and all that. Awfully
busy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;you&mdash;are!&rdquo; laughed Cora, who was with
her friend. &ldquo;We see you on the roads, flying by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then Grace appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are, Walter!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! all right,&rdquo; answered the boy, and got out
quickly to crank up.</p>

<p>Linda tossed her head as Nan followed Grace
down the front steps. &ldquo;That is what it means, eh?&rdquo;
she whispered to Cora. &ldquo;That poverty-stricken Nan
Sherwood! I wonder if Walter knows he&rsquo;s taking
out a pauper in that handsome car.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! maybe Nan isn&rsquo;t quite a pauper,&rdquo; said Cora
doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she is! And a thief! Or, she tried to
be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[199]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You know Mrs. Cupp warned you about repeating
that story, Linda,&rdquo; said Cora, hastily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! just the same there&rsquo;ll be another story
to tell,&rdquo; muttered Linda, watching the automobile
party get under way with envious eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just
fix that Nan Sherwood; you see!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the automobile Walter found time to say to
Nan, when Grace could not hear: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully
sorry you&rsquo;re in trouble, Nan. I wish I could help
you. We all like you tremendously. You know
that, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you mean it, Walter,&rdquo; said Nan, winking
fast to keep back the tears. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s just <i>dear</i>
of you to say so. Thanks!&rdquo; and Nan pressed the
boy&rsquo;s offered hand warmly.</p>

<p>The Grand Guard Ball, a social event that shook
Freeling and the surrounding towns to their social
centre, was to be held on this evening. The older
girls of Lakeview Hall were usually allowed to
attend the assembly under the care of one or two
teachers. Sometimes Dr. Beulah Prescott herself
attended the ball.</p>

<p>Nan did not really care to go; but Bess insisted,
and would not go without her. Mrs. Harley had
seen to it that both girls had pretty party dresses,
and these compared well with the frocks worn by
the other girls who filled Charley&rsquo;s old omnibus and
the several automobiles that transported the pupils
from Lakeview Hall to the ball.<span class="pagenum">[200]</span></p>

<p>Linda Riggs wore a frock as unfitted for her age
as Mrs. Cupp would allow. It was noticed, too,
that Linda did not wear the pretty coral necklace she
had displayed so frequently during the term. That
was around Cora&rsquo;s pretty throat, while Linda&rsquo;s neck
was bare of any ornament. Mrs. Cupp did not
attend the assembly on this occasion. She hurried
off to the village early in the evening, having received
a note from her sister, Miss Vane. Some of
the girls said that Mrs. Cupp and her sister were
in trouble over an orphan boy whom Miss Sadie
Vane had once taken to bring up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was more like a bond-slave than an adopted
son, I reckon,&rdquo; Susan told Laura Polk, in her gossipy
way. &ldquo;If you gals yere think Mrs. Cupp is a
Tartar, yo&rsquo;d ought to have some &rsquo;sperience with
Miss Sadie Vane. I wo&rsquo;ked fo&rsquo; her once. Never
again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to the boy?&rdquo; Laura asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He done run away, and now it tu&rsquo;ns out that
there&rsquo;s money comin&rsquo; to him an&rsquo; the &rsquo;thorities want
to know whar he done gone. It&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; Miss
Vane a sight of trouble&mdash;an&rsquo; sarve her right!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This story Laura, of course, told to her chums;
but nobody expressed any sorrow for Mrs. Cupp
but Nan. The latter could not help but feel that,
after all, the matron had shown her some kindness,
even if she had told Dr. Prescott about the boathouse
banquet.<span class="pagenum">[201]</span></p>

<p>Dr. Prescott did not herself attend the Grand
Guard Ball. Mademoiselle Loro was very near-sighted,
and Miss Gleason, the physical culture instructor,
who also went to chaperon the girls, was
not of an observant nature.</p>

<p>Therefore, when Linda Riggs suddenly blazed
out in all the glory of a diamond and ruby necklace
in an old-fashioned setting &ldquo;more fit,&rdquo; as
Amelia Boggs said, &ldquo;for a Choctaw princess to
wear than a white girl!&rdquo; there really was nobody
to forbid the display.</p>

<p>People remarked about it, however. It was plainly
a family heirloom and very valuable. If it was
done to advertise Mr. Riggs&rsquo; wealth, it was in poor
taste, and Dr. Prescott certainly would be greatly
displeased if she heard of Linda&rsquo;s action. However,
nobody had any concern about that unless it
was Linda herself.</p>

<p>The girls enjoyed every minute they were allowed
to remain at the ball. Each girl was allowed three
dances, and the question of partners was a burning
one.</p>

<p>Walter Mason had done yeoman&rsquo;s duty in this
matter. He knew every youth who attended the
ball. He was indefatigable in introducing them to
his sister and the other girls from the Hall. Even
Amelia had partners for her three dances.</p>

<p>In fact, only one girl missed the full complement
of dances. That was Linda. She was so angry<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
with Walter that she refused to let him introduce
any of his friends, and in return Walter did not
ask her to dance at all. So the Linda Riggs&rsquo; clique,
and Nan and the Masons, were very much at odds
when they went back to the hall at ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>The necklace disappeared from Linda&rsquo;s neck before
the Hall was reached. But in the morning, at
breakfast time, it appeared again in a most surprising
bit of gossip. Around the tables went the
rumor, flying from lip to lip:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Linda&rsquo;s beautiful necklace is gone! She&rsquo;s in
her room in tears and will not be comforted. She
declares it has been stolen.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>THE HUMILIATION OF LINDA</small></h2>


<p>Early in the morning after the Grand Guard
Ball in Freeling, Nan Sherwood had an adventure.</p>

<p>She had spent part of the previous day writing
another letter to her mother, and that she finished,
sealed, stamped and mailed in the school letter-bag.
This time she knew that no ill-natured girl would
get hold of it. But, of course, the whole school
knew by this time that she was going to leave at the
end of the term, and that &ldquo;her folks weren&rsquo;t rich at
all, so there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not that Nan had ever talked about the Scotch
legacy more than she could help; and certainly she
had not boasted to the girls of her wealth. There
are certain natures, however, who envy the successful,
and Nan had been very successful in making
friends, in finding favor with the teachers, and in
standing well in her classes.</p>

<p>So even some girls whom she had been kind to,
were glad to repeat now the story of Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s
coming poverty as first circulated by Linda
Riggs and her satellites. Nan had heard many unkind<span class="pagenum">[204]</span>
whispers, and when alone she grieved over this.</p>

<p>By reason of her fretting, she did not sleep well
after the ball, and she arose long before the gong
sounded and when it was still quite dark. There
was a paring of silver moon low on the horizon,
which looked as though it had been sewed into the
black velvet robe of Night; and the robe was
trimmed with sparkling silver and red stars as well.</p>

<p>The air was keen, although there was no wind;
and the hoarfrost hung from the bushes and dried
grass-blades, while there was a rime of it the length
of the balustrade to the beach. Nan ran down this
flight to see if the ice would bear yet. Skating was
in the offing, and she and Bess loved to skate.</p>

<p>Professor Krenner had reported the day before
that the strait between the lake shore where his
cabin stood, and the Isle of Hope, half a mile out
in the lake, was skimmed over with ice. Here, at
the foot of the flight of stairs and along by the
haunted boathouse, the edge of the water was
fringed with a crust of thin ice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much more fun for me at dear old Lakeview
Hall,&rdquo; Nan was thinking as she skipped lightly
along the edge of this uncertain ice. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll get
my skates sharpened, as Bess begged me. That will
not be a <i>great</i> extravagance. We&rsquo;ll have some good
fun before the term closes and we go home for the
holidays. Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The sigh was not because of the home-going. It<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
was for the reason that Nan felt very sure that
she would never see the Hall again.</p>

<p>Just as she was thinking this and watching idly
the broken water far out in the strait toward the
Isle of Hope, she put her foot upon a strip of ice
and, to her amazement, it broke through and she
plunged knee deep in the icy water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! <i>Oh!</i> OH!&rdquo; she gasped, in graduated surprise.</p>

<p>For as she strove to pull out the first foot, her
other one went&mdash;<i>slump</i>&mdash;right through the ice,
too. And it was cold!</p>

<p>Nan was not frightened at first. She was an
athletic girl, and very strong and agile. But she
was amazed to find that both feet were fast in the
half-frozen slime at the bottom of this hole into
which she had stepped. She strove to pull her feet
free, and actually could not do it!</p>

<p>Then, as she lifted her head to look about for
help, she saw a figure in black running hard toward
her. It came from the rear of the big boathouse.
It was a slight figure, and Nan immediately thought
of &ldquo;the black dog&rdquo; that had chased Mrs. Cupp the
night of the boathouse party.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you! I&rsquo;ll get you!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy,
for such in reality he was, and he threw forward a
tough branch for Nan to cling to.</p>

<p>She accepted this aid gladly. At first she almost
drew him into the water. Then he braced his heels<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
in the bank and flung himself back to balance her
weight. First one foot and then the other Nan
pulled out of the icy mire, and in half a minute
she was ashore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! how can I thank you?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;If you
hadn&rsquo;t been here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right&mdash;it&rsquo;s all right, Miss,&rdquo; the boy stammered,
and immediately began to back away. &ldquo;You
needn&rsquo;t thank me. I&rsquo;d have done it for anybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan was eyeing the lad curiously. Many thoughts
beside those of gratitude for his timely help, were
passing through her mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked abruptly. &ldquo;Do you
live around here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy was a pale youth, but he flushed deeply
now and edged farther away, as though he really
feared her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I live near here. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m glad I could
help you. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Nan could stop him by word or act, he
turned around and ran up the shore of the lake
until he was hidden from the girl&rsquo;s surprised view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! isn&rsquo;t that the strangest thing?&rdquo; demanded
Nan, of nobody at all. Then she realized that she
was getting very cold indeed, standing there with
wet feet and ankles, and she herself started on a run
for the steps to the top of the bluff, and had just
time enough to get to the Hall and change her
shoes and stockings before breakfast.<span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>At the table she was giving to Bess an eager account
of her adventure when Laura Polk said to the
chums from Tillbury:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heard the latest, girls?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. What is the latest?&rdquo; asked Bess.
&ldquo;Nan&rsquo;s got a yarn to tell that almost passes human
belief. She seems to have interviewed a ghost and
got her feet wet at the same time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; declared Laura. &ldquo;Linda&rsquo;s
lost that beautiful necklace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! you don&rsquo;t mean it?&rdquo; gasped Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor girl!&rdquo; exclaimed Nan, with sympathy.
&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The deponent knoweth not,&rdquo; said Laura, tightly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big loss&mdash;bigger than that awful maxim Miss
Craven used to teach all us girls: &lsquo;Lost! Somewhere
between sunrise and sunset, two golden
hours, each set with sixty diamond minutes. No reward
is offered, for they are gone forever!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How ridiculous!&rdquo; chuckled Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no laughing matter, girls,&rdquo; said Nan, with
gravity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What isn&rsquo;t; the maxim?&rdquo; cried Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Linda&rsquo;s loss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! What do I care?&rdquo; scoffed Bess. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
wasting no tears over Linda.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that lovely necklace!&rdquo; cried Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a beauty,&rdquo; admitted Laura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! her father won&rsquo;t mind. He has more money<span class="pagenum">[208]</span>
than anybody else in the world&mdash;to hear her tell
it,&rdquo; laughed the heartless Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t help being foolish, I suppose,&rdquo; added
Laura.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She showed how silly she was by wearing the
necklace,&rdquo; Bess declared. &ldquo;Maybe a burglar saw
it; and followed her home, and stole it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cupp rang her bell sharply. &ldquo;Young ladies!&rdquo;
she exclaimed, when there was comparative
silence. &ldquo;Young ladies! Attention! Miss
Sherwood is wanted in Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s office at
once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Many of the girls stared at Nan as she slowly
arose, her breakfast partly eaten. More than one
whisper went around the tables. One girl asked
right out loud:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder what Dr. Prescott wants her for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know!&rdquo; squealed the eager voice of one of the
younger pupils. &ldquo;I came right past Linda Riggs&rsquo;
door, and I heard her say to Cora Courtney that
she knew Nan stole that necklace!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; The exclamation was general. But
Amelia Boggs&rsquo; voice rose above the confusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You miserable infant!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You ought
to be spanked and put to bed for a week!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young ladies!&rdquo; came in Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s stern voice,
&ldquo;less confusion, please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan had risen in some trepidation to go to the
principal&rsquo;s study. But the suggestion that she was<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
wanted because Linda had lost her necklace almost
bound her feet where she stood. It seemed to Nan
as though she could not move.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nan! Nan!&rdquo; cried Bess, jumping up, her face
ablaze. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a story, a wicked story! They sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t
treat you so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her arm was over Nan&rsquo;s shoulders and she was
crying, frankly. Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s voice again was heard
above the noise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Elizabeth! Sit down!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reckless Bess paid no attention to the command,
but went on with Nan to the door. This
flagrant disobeying of the matron&rsquo;s order awed the
other girls to silence.</p>

<p>Bess left her chum in the hall and came back, her
eyes streaming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you do to me, Mrs. Cupp, so
there!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Nan is shamefully abused.
You can punish me all you want to, Mrs. Cupp, only
don&rsquo;t tell me to keep my mouth closed for a week,
for I&mdash;just&mdash;could&mdash;not&mdash;do&mdash;it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe you, Elizabeth,&rdquo; said the matron, drily,
preparing to follow Nan Sherwood. &ldquo;I will attend
to your case later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the principal&rsquo;s office Nan found Linda in tears
and Dr. Prescott looking very grave indeed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know anything about the loss of Linda&rsquo;s
necklace, my dear?&rdquo; the preceptress said kindly to
Nan.<span class="pagenum">[210]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Dr. Prescott,&rdquo; whispered Nan, her face very
white and her lips fairly blue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is sufficient, Nancy. You are mistaken,
Linda. And it is a mistake that can hardly be
excused.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You just take her word for it!&rdquo; cried Linda,
wildly. &ldquo;And my father will about <i>kill</i> me when he
knows grandmother&rsquo;s necklace is gone. She&rsquo;s
a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do!&rdquo; Dr. Prescott sternly warned her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care! She&rsquo;s a pauper! Nobody else in
the school is poor enough to <i>want</i> to steal. She tried
to take my bag on the train&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more of it!&rdquo; commanded Dr. Prescott,
rising angrily. &ldquo;You are incorrigible, Linda.
First of all, I want to know how you came to have
the necklace to wear. Mrs. Cupp tells me she strictly
forbade you to take it out of your trunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cupp entered at that moment. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
Henry,&rdquo; she said shortly to the doctor. &ldquo;He has
something to show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man came in, wiping his snowy boots on the
mat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it, Henry?&rdquo; asked the troubled principal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This, Mum,&rdquo; said Henry, holding out something
that glittered in his hand. &ldquo;I reckon &rsquo;tis some gewgaw
of the young ladies. I found it under a window
with some trash from a wastepaper basket,<span class="pagenum">[211]</span>
and I want you to be tellin&rsquo; &rsquo;em again that I will
<i>not</i> have &rsquo;em throwing trash out o&rsquo; window.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My necklace!&rdquo; shrieked Linda, and leaped to
seize it.</p>

<p>But Henry closed his hand, and Linda might as
well have tried to open a bank-vault without the
combination.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to me,&rdquo; said Dr. Prescott, soberly.
&ldquo;When did you empty your basket out of the window,
Linda?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;La&mdash;last night&mdash;after we got home from the
ball. I forgot it yesterday and it was&mdash;was too
full,&rdquo; wept Linda.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your necklace went out of the window with
it,&rdquo; said Dr. Prescott, sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at that child!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Mrs.
Cupp. The matron crossed the room quickly and
caught poor Nan before she fell. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s just about
made sick by this,&rdquo; she said tartly. &ldquo;Why! she&rsquo;s
fainted. And she&rsquo;s feverish! Here&rsquo;s a pretty to-do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The principal hurried to Nan&rsquo;s side and looked
into her pallid face. &ldquo;There is trouble here&mdash;more
trouble than we know about,&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take her to her room. In here! You may go,
Henry. Thank you! And you return to your room,
Linda. We will look further into this affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half an hour later Mrs. Cupp came out of the
principal&rsquo;s suite of rooms with a troubled face, and
telephoned for Dr. Larry, the school physician.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[212]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>BEAUTIFUL BEULAH</small></h2>


<p>Nan did not know very much about it. She had
a dreamy remembrance of the first day or two of
her sojourn in what the girls called &ldquo;the sick bay.&rdquo;
She remembered Dr. Larry&rsquo;s kind face leaning
above her; and she realized that he was there a great
deal at first.</p>

<p>The fact was, the physician made a hard fight to
ward off the threatened attack of pneumonia that
he feared. Nan had been in a receptive state for
sudden illness when she slipped into the icy water
that morning&mdash;worried in mind, and having eaten
little for several meals. Then was added to this
the mental shock of Linda&rsquo;s accusation.</p>

<p>Her mind wandered, and Dr. Prescott and Mrs.
Cupp heard a great deal about a &ldquo;black ghost&rdquo; and
a &ldquo;boy in black&rdquo; who were trying to get Linda
Riggs&rsquo; necklace away from Nan. This troubled
the girl greatly in her first delirium.</p>

<p>Then she wandered to Scotland and took up the
burden of her parents&rsquo; financial troubles. She
tried to get them home on the boat, but they had no
tickets, and the captain would not trust them for<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
their passage. These and many other imaginary
troubles helped to confuse the poor girl&rsquo;s mind.</p>

<p>But finally the delirium settled into one thing.
Nan wanted Beulah!</p>

<p>At first the principal thought she meant <i>her</i>.
Dr. Prescott knew, of course, that her girls called
her in affection &ldquo;Dr. Beulah.&rdquo; She came to the
bedside as often as Nan cried out the name. But
soon it was apparent that the principal&rsquo;s kind and
beautiful face did not assuage Nan&rsquo;s longing.</p>

<p>The girl talked intimately to &ldquo;Beautiful Beulah&rdquo;
about &ldquo;Momsey&rdquo; and &ldquo;Papa Sherwood.&rdquo; &ldquo;If we
were only back, all together again, in the little dwelling
in amity,&rdquo; weakly cried the sick girl. &ldquo;Oh,
Beulah! I haven&rsquo;t been nice to you. I&rsquo;ve been
ashamed of you! I was afraid of what the girls
would say, and that Mrs. Cupp would think I was a
baby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can the poor child mean?&rdquo; demanded the
worried principal, of the matron. &ldquo;Dr. Larry says
that this worrying over the mysterious &lsquo;Beulah&rsquo; is
doing her more harm than anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s face was very grim. She was not a
sympathetic looking woman at best. Now she
looked more severe than ever. She marched out of
the sick room without a word. She had already
removed from about Nan&rsquo;s neck the fine gold chain
and key. In a few minutes she marched in again,
to Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s unbounded surprise, and laid a<span class="pagenum">[214]</span>
wonderful, big, pink-cheeked doll beside Nan in the
bed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Cupp, it seems, had a pretty exact knowledge
of everything hidden at the bottom of the girls&rsquo;
trunks, after all.</p>

<p>When Nan aroused the next time, there was
Beautiful Beulah right in the crook of her arm.
She smiled, hugged the doll close to her, took her
medicine without a murmur, and went at once to
sleep again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little girl,&rdquo; said good Dr. Larry when he
was told about it. &ldquo;Of course that wasn&rsquo;t what
has been really troubling her, Dr. Prescott. But
the doll is connected with a happier time, when she
was at home with her absent parents. With that
wax beauty in her possession all troubles look
smaller to her youthful mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did think Nancy Sherwood was too big for
doll-babies!&rdquo; sniffed Mrs. Cupp, refusing to show
any further tenderness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see how she feels,&rdquo; said Dr. Prescott, understandingly.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tempted to play with that beautiful
thing myself. Nancy loves babies, and is
as kind as she can be to the smaller girls. It would
not hurt some of the girls older than she if they
&lsquo;played dolls&rsquo; again. They are altogether too
grown-up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess was at the door of the sick room morning,
noon and night. As soon as the physician said there<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
was no danger, Nan&rsquo;s chum was allowed in the
room. When she saw the big doll on the pillow beside
Nan&rsquo;s head, she uttered a large, round &ldquo;O!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you ever see it before, Elizabeth?&rdquo; asked
the principal, curiously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;why! It&rsquo;s Beautiful Beulah! Beg pardon,
Dr. Prescott! it isn&rsquo;t named after you. Nan had it
ever so many years ago. My! I never suspected it
was in existence. And to bring it to school with
her! My!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s vitality brought her out of the &ldquo;sick bay&rdquo;
in a short time. She lost only a week from her books
altogether. That, she told herself, did not so much
matter when her time at Lakeview Hall was to be
so short.</p>

<p>But she was faithful, and hurried to make up the
lost recitations. Linda Riggs was in retirement,
disgraced before the whole school. She had been
obliged to publicly deny the story she had started
about Nan Sherwood and the lost necklace. And,
too, the necklace had been sent by registered post to
Mr. Riggs with a sharp letter from Dr. Prescott
reminding him that the girls of Lakeview Hall were
not allowed to wear such jewelry.</p>

<p>Some of the girls were inclined to poke fun at
Nan&rsquo;s big doll, which was brought up into Room
Seven, Corridor Four, and given a place of honor
there. But it was gentle fun, for the whole school
was sorry for Nan now. They knew that she must<span class="pagenum">[216]</span>
leave the Hall at the end of the term because of
financial reverses, and the girls were beginning to
find out how lovable she was, and to remember how
kind she had been to everybody.</p>

<p>Procrastination Boggs crocheted a shawl for
Beautiful Beulah and Laura Polk brought a tiny
embroidered cap that fitted the doll&rsquo;s head perfectly.
Bess made leggings for Nan&rsquo;s &ldquo;child&rdquo; and Gracie
Mason presented a pair of fur-trimmed boots.
Really, there never was so lucky a doll &ldquo;baby&rdquo; as
Beautiful Beulah, for she had presents galore.</p>

<p>Nan could not refuse any of these gifts, and most
of them came with funny little notes. The doll was
made much of by everybody in Corridor Four.
She was decked and re-decked in all the finery that
came to her and many of the girls &ldquo;looked in&rdquo; at
Room Seven every day, just to see how Nan&rsquo;s
&ldquo;child&rdquo; got along.</p>

<p>The girl from Tillbury began to notice that some
of the biggest of them liked to hold the doll and
dress and redress it; and &ldquo;there was a deal of fuss,&rdquo;
as Mrs. Cupp said, made over the pretty blue-eyed
thing.</p>

<p>Finally Laura had a bright idea. She suggested
that a party be given in Beautiful Beulah&rsquo;s honor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A regular, sure-enough, honest-to-goodness
party!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Why not? Everybody bring
something to give the child&mdash;have a regular &lsquo;shower&rsquo;
party.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[217]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness! haven&rsquo;t we had parties enough for
one term?&rdquo; demanded Nan. &ldquo;That one at the boathouse
seemed to fill the bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing like that! We might not get out
of it so easy again,&rdquo; admitted the red-haired girl.
&ldquo;And, anyway, that&rsquo;s ancient history. Let&rsquo;s have
it in the afternoon and feed &rsquo;em tea and cakes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess was enthusiastic immediately. She had been
quite subdued since the boathouse party, and Nan&rsquo;s
sickness; she was &ldquo;just aching&rdquo; for something to
happen! Anything &ldquo;doing&rdquo; always delighted Bess;
but the trouble with Nan&rsquo;s chum was, she <i>would</i>
try to mix the business of studying with pleasure.</p>

<p>She started to crochet a &ldquo;fascinator&rdquo; (so Amelia
Boggs called it) for Nan&rsquo;s doll, and fearing she
would not get it done in time she carried the crocheting
with her into German class, Frau Deuseldorf
was not particularly sharp-sighted; but her
hearing was not failing; and when she addressed
Bess twice without receiving any reply it was only
natural that the German teacher should step down
from the platform to see what the brown head was
doing, bent so low over Elizabeth&rsquo;s book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell, vell, vell!&rdquo; exclaimed the teacher, in some
excitement. &ldquo;Vas iss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! One, two, three, <i>and</i> four!&rdquo; muttered the
earnest Bess. &ldquo;Did&mdash;did you speak to me, Madam?&rdquo;
and the girl looked up dreamily, poising the crocheting
needle before taking up the next stitch.<span class="pagenum">[218]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ach! what is the child doing?&rdquo; demanded the
lady, seizing the work in Bess&rsquo; hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Madam Deuseldorf!&rdquo; shrieked Bess. &ldquo;You
made me drop a stitch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drop a stitch? Drop a stitch?&rdquo; repeated the
lady, in some heat. &ldquo;Undt vy shouldt you have
stitches to drop in classroom? Tell me that,
please!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; poor Bess stammered,
Frau Deuseldorf could be very stern when she
wished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What iss this for?&rdquo; demanded the teacher,
holding up the confiscated &ldquo;fascinator&rdquo; and shaking
it in the air so that all the girls began to
giggle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s for the party,&rdquo; blurted out Bess, very red
in the face.</p>

<p>Just then Dr. Beulah and half a dozen visitors&mdash;some
of them gentlemen&mdash;entered the classroom.
The situation was tragic&mdash;for poor Bess. There
stood Frau Deuseldorf in commanding attitude, her
back to the door, unconscious of the approach of
the preceptress and her friends, and waving the
unfinished bit of crocheting in the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For why did you come here to Lakeview, Miss?&rdquo;
demanded the teacher. &ldquo;To knit&mdash;to sew&mdash;to <i>play?</i>
Ach! I do not teach a class in baby-doll r-r-rags,
I hope! Remove yourself to the platform, Miss.
Take this&mdash;this plaything with you. Sit down there<span class="pagenum">[219]</span>
that the other pupils may see how you employ your
hands and mind in class&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned majestically and saw the amused visitors.
Even Dr. Beulah seemed to relish the situation,
for her eyes twinkled and her lips twitched a
little as she said&mdash;to cover the German lady&rsquo;s confusion:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The time is not propitious for a visit to <i>your</i>
class, Madam, I can plainly see. We will withdraw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not speak sternly; but Nan&mdash;who was
watching&mdash;saw that Frau Deuseldorf turned
strangely pallid and that her hands shook as she
went back to her desk, following the angry and
tearful Bess. After a moment, when the girls had
settled into something like their usual calm, and
had stopped giggling, the lady leaned over and
patted Bess softly on the shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind, my dear,&rdquo; she said, her voice vibrant
with some feeling that the girls who heard
her did not understand. &ldquo;Put the foolish trifle on
my desk here and go back to your book. You are
punished enough. Ach! perhaps I am, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Nan Sherwood noted the fact that the German
lady was much troubled during the rest of
the session. She wondered why.</p>

<p>Like several of the instructors at Lakeview Hall,
Frau Deuseldorf did not sleep on the premises.
&ldquo;Mister&rdquo; Frau Deuseldorf kept a delicatessen shop<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
in town and the couple had rooms behind the shop.
The German instructor&rsquo;s husband, whom all the girls
called &ldquo;Mister Frau Deuseldorf,&rdquo; was a pursy, self-important
little man, with a bristling pompadour
and mustache. He was like a gnome with a military
bearing&mdash;if you can imagine such a person!</p>

<p>When Frau Deuseldorf put her heavily shod foot
over the threshold of the delicatessen shop she at
once became the typical German hausfrau, and
nothing else. Her University training was set
aside. She cooked her husband&rsquo;s dinner with her
own hands and then served him in approved German
style.</p>

<p>It was the very afternoon of Bess Harley&rsquo;s trouble
in German class that Nan and she chanced to
have an errand in town and obtained permission
from Mrs. Cupp to go there. The girls often
bought delicacies of Mister Deuseldorf&mdash;his cheeses
and <i>wurst</i> had quite a special flavor, and he made
lovely potato salad that often graced the secret banquets
at Lakeview Hall.</p>

<p>As Nan and Bess came along Main Street, there
was the little, bristle-haired Teuton, standing at his
door. His bald head was bare and he wore carpet
slippers and no coat. As the light was fading, he
evidently had come to the door to read a letter
which he held close to his purblind eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frau Deuseldorf hasn&rsquo;t come down from the
Hall yet&mdash;mean old thing!&rdquo; ejaculated Bess.<span class="pagenum">[221]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t call her names. <i>I</i> think she was
awfully easy on you,&rdquo; Nan said, smiling. &ldquo;And
she seemed worried, too, because Dr. Beulah caught
the classroom in such a turmoil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it wasn&rsquo;t <i>my</i> fault,&rdquo; grumbled Bess, knowing,
of course, that it was, but wishing to excuse
herself if she could.</p>

<p>Nan made no immediate reply. She was watching
the little German compassionately. As he stood
there in the open door scanning the rustling sheet
of paper, the girl saw that frank tears were running
down his plump cheeks. Nan clutched her chum&rsquo;s
wrist, and whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bess! what do you suppose is the matter
with Mister Frau Deuseldorf?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? How? Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess, likewise
seeing the little man&rsquo;s emotion as he turned back
into the shop. &ldquo;Why, Nan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Nan. &ldquo;He was crying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in,&rdquo; suggested the impulsive Bess.
&ldquo;Maybe he will tell us about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t like to intrude,&rdquo; Nan
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on! We&rsquo;ll buy a pickle,&rdquo; exclaimed Bess.
&ldquo;Surely he won&rsquo;t think <i>that</i> very much of an intrusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the tinkling little bell over the door announced
the girls&rsquo; entrance the German appeared
from the rear premises, wiping his eyes on a checked<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
handkerchief. He knew the two girls from the Hall
by sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goot afternoon, fraulein,&rdquo; he said, in greeting.
&ldquo;Iss de school oudt yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of the classes are over for the day, sir,&rdquo;
Nan replied, as Bess took much time in selecting
the wartiest and biggest pickle in the Deuseldorf
collection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Iss mein Frau come the town in yet?&rdquo; pursued
the little man, whose idiomatic speech often amused
the girls when they came to the store.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe she was correcting exercises, sir,&rdquo; Nan
said, smiling. &ldquo;I expect we girls make her much
extra trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ach!&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;Trouble we haf in blenty&mdash;yes.
But <i>that</i> iss light trouble. Idt iss of
our Hans undt Fritz we haf de most trouble.
Yes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan and Bess knew that the German couple
worked only, and saved and &ldquo;scrimped&rdquo; only, for
the support of two grown sons in the military service
of the Fatherland. They desired that Hans and
Fritz should have the best, and marry well. But
for a young Prussian officer to keep up appearances
and hold a footing among his mates, costs much
more than his wage as a soldier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope your sons are well, Herr Deuseldorf,&rdquo;
Nan said, speaking carefully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vell? Ja&mdash;they no sickness have. But there<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
iss more trouble as sickness&mdash;Ach! mein Frau, she
come!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Bess had selected the pickle. The little German
gave them no more attention, but darted out from
behind the counter to meet Frau Deuseldorf as she
entered the shop. He waved the letter he had been
reading excitedly, and began in high-pitched German
to tell his wife the news&mdash;and news of trouble
it was, indeed, as the two American girls could understand.</p>

<p>Both Bess and Nan had studied German a year
before they came to the Hall, and rapidly as the
little man talked they could understand much that
he said. The slower replies of his startled wife
they could likewise apprehend.</p>

<p>Nan and Bess clung together near the door, hesitating
to depart, for Mister Frau Deuseldorf had
not given Bess her change.</p>

<p>Hans was in trouble&mdash;serious trouble. His
brother, Fritz, wrote that it would take all the old
couple&rsquo;s little savings to save Hans from disgrace;
and one brother&rsquo;s disgrace would seriously affect
the career of the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And perhaps I have offended the good Dr. Prescott
this very day,&rdquo; cried Frau Deuseldorf. &ldquo;You
know how it was at that other school last year,
Henry.&rdquo; (The German teacher had only been at
Lakeview Hall half a year before this present term.)
&ldquo;Dr. Prescott, too, is very, very stern. She entered<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>
my classroom, with friends, just as one
of those thoughtless girls had made me excited.
The room was in a turmoil&mdash;Ach! it would be
terrible now if the doctor requested my resignation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan drew Bess outside into the street. &ldquo;Never
mind the change, Bessie,&rdquo; she begged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m so ashamed of myself,&rdquo; sighed Bess.
&ldquo;I never knew people had so much trouble. And
those sons are men grown!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Their children, just the same. But I know she
is over-anxious about her position. I don&rsquo;t suppose
the little shop earns them very much. It is probably
her salary at the school which goes to Germany.
Oh, my dear! you don&rsquo;t suppose Dr. Beulah
<i>is</i> angry with Frau Deuseldorf because she does not
keep good order in her classes? We do bother her
a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess was very serious. &ldquo;I know <i>I</i> do,&rdquo; she admitted.
&ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s fun to plague her&mdash;she
gets excited so easily, and forgets her polite English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We mustn&rsquo;t any more,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just know what I am going to do,&rdquo; muttered
Bess; but Nan did not hear her.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was impulsive; of late she had shown
more strongly than before the influence Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s
character had had upon her own disposition.
She felt herself at fault because of the scene that<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
day in German class and Frau Deuseldorf feared
she would be blamed for it.</p>

<p>Dr. Beulah Prescott had never seemed like a very
harsh person to Bess; but the girl approached the
office that evening before supper with some timidity.
It had always been a hard thing for Bess Harley
to admit that she was wrong in any case; and now,
when Dr. Beulah was looking at her quizzically,
the girl from Tillbury shrank from the ordeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Elizabeth! you do not often seek my desk,
my dear,&rdquo; said the preceptress pleasantly. &ldquo;What is
it you wish?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Dr. Prescott!&rdquo; exclaimed Bess, going headlong
into the matter as usual. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about Frau
Deuseldorf.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Prescott&rsquo;s pretty brows drew together a little;
but perhaps it was a puzzled line instead of anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about your German instructor?&rdquo; she asked
quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear Dr. Prescott! you won&rsquo;t blame her for
that trouble in class to-day&mdash;will you? It was I.
I did it. I was crocheting instead of attending to
the work. And you know how easy it is for her to
get excited. Please blame me and not her, Dr.
Prescott.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear child!&rdquo; gasped the lady, in some surprise.
&ldquo;Perhaps I do not just understand. Sit
down here. Now, be quiet, and don&rsquo;t sob so. Tell
me all about it.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[226]</span></p>

<p>And Bess managed soon to control herself and
explain fully her reason for coming to &ldquo;beg off&rdquo;
for Frau Deuseldorf. The preceptress listened
quietly; nor did she smile at Bess Harley&rsquo;s way of
trying to straighten out the affair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a kind girl,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I am glad
to see that&mdash;despite your thoughtlessness&mdash;you consider
others. You should consider the Madam always
in class, for she has a hard time enough at
the best. I know she is easily excited; but I judge
her work from results. I am quite satisfied with
her and have no intention of disturbing her about
that contretemps to-day. Indeed, I should not have
mentioned it to her had you not told me how she
felt about it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will send Henry down town with a note at
once to her. She shall sleep in peace to-night, after
all, if my assurance of good will and sympathy will
help her to do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The news of the German teacher&rsquo;s trouble circulated
among the girls and it was noticeable that
those who took German were more careful about
giving the good, if excitable, lady trouble during
the weeks that immediately followed.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Bess finished the &ldquo;fascinator.&rdquo; The
other girls friendly to the chums in Room Seven,
Corridor Four, brought gifts, too. Beautiful Beulah
had an afternoon reception that was the talk
of the Hall for weeks.<span class="pagenum">[227]</span></p>

<p>Of course, the little folk came; Nan was friends
with every child in the primary grades, and she invited
them to come and bring their dolls. There
was tea and cakes enough for all; and the &ldquo;reception&rdquo;
overflowed into the corridor. Mademoiselle
Loro (who had taken a great fancy to Nan Sherwood)
presided at the tea-table. The little Frenchwoman
had by no means forgotten her youth and
she did not cast any &ldquo;damper&rdquo; upon the occasion,
as Bess Harley was afraid she would.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how it is, Nan,&rdquo; said Bess, when
the entertainment was over and they were alone.
&ldquo;You are just the funniest girl I ever heard of.
Any other girl would never have thought of inviting
a teacher to a doll&rsquo;s party; if she had, the girls
would have been afraid to come. But we had a
splendid time, and I shall try to please Mademoiselle
more in the future. She&rsquo;s an awfully nice old
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan only smiled. In her wise little brain this
very result had been foreseen. She had begun to
see that when the girls and the teachers only met
in the classroom, or at meals, they did not &ldquo;warm
up to each other&rdquo;; social intercourse with their instructors
made the girls less antagonistic toward
them.</p>

<p>The weather grew colder and the ice was pronounced
safe. Skating began, and the chums from
Tillbury soon showed the other girls how well they<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>
could skate together. Walter Mason declared he
had just as soon skate with Nan Sherwood as with
any boy he knew.</p>

<p>Nan and Bess went down to Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s room
one day to ask for the privilege of going to town
to get their skates sharpened. It was late afternoon
and growing dusky in the stairways. There was
no light in Mrs. Cupp&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>Before the girls reached the top of the flight leading
to the basement they heard the matron scream.
Then a sharp, shrill voice cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want my money! Give me my money! You
and Miss Vane are trying to keep it from me. I
want my money!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go away! Go away!&rdquo; the startled girls heard
Mrs. Cupp murmur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll haunt you! I&rsquo;ll foller you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bess had uttered a cry. Out of the matron&rsquo;s
room scuttled a thin, black figure, which darted
down the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boathouse ghost!&rdquo; gasped Bess, clinging to
Nan, in fright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness!&rdquo; returned Nan. &ldquo;If it is, he&rsquo;s a long
way off his beat, isn&rsquo;t he? Boathouse ghost, indeed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when they went into the matron&rsquo;s room they
found Mrs. Cupp lying back in her chair, in a pitiable
state of fright.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[229]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>ALL ABOUT THE BOATHOUSE GHOST</small></h2>


<p>Susan, her black face set in a very grim expression,
came to wait upon Mrs. Cupp. &ldquo;Go &rsquo;long,
chillen,&rdquo; she commanded, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;tend to her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s been dreadfully frightened, Susan,&rdquo;
cried Nan, sympathetically.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She saw a ghost, Susan,&rdquo; whispered Bess, perhaps
a little wickedly.</p>

<p>Susan rolled her eyes. &ldquo;Go &rsquo;long, chile! Wot
ghos&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boathouse ghost, I declare!&rdquo; said Bess, with
decision. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it, Nan? All black&mdash;and small&mdash;and
it squealed. Didn&rsquo;t it, Nan?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a boy,&rdquo; said her chum. &ldquo;And he ran
down cellar. Somebody ought to look into it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Into the cellar?&rdquo; asked Bess, with a giggle, as
Susan &ldquo;shooed&rdquo; them out of the matron&rsquo;s room and
shut the door at their backs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. Just that,&rdquo; said Nan, decidedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where do you suppose that boy went&mdash;if it was
a boy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; Nan said, hesitating at the top of the
stairs.<span class="pagenum">[230]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You <i>know?&rdquo;</i> cried Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Positively!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Goodness me! Is this another of your secrets,
Nan Sherwood? You are the very meanest girl
for a chum&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never told you about this because so many
other things came in between and made me forget,&rdquo;
confessed Nan, quickly. &ldquo;Come on! Let me show
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She started down the basement stairs, but Bess
hung back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about following a ghost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! It&rsquo;s only a boy,&rdquo; said Nan. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
the very boy who pulled me out of the water the
other morning. And he&rsquo;s somebody else, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean, and I don&rsquo;t know
where you&rsquo;re leading me,&rdquo; grumbled Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the trunk-room,&rdquo; said Nan, answering one
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But that boy could not get in there. The door&rsquo;s
locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; said Nan, hurrying on.</p>

<p>In a few moments they were down the dark
passageway and at the door. It was wide open.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, how do you suppose that happened?&rdquo;
queried Bess. &ldquo;Mrs. Cupp is so particular about
keeping it locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The boy opened it when he came through,&rdquo; said
Nan.<span class="pagenum">[231]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>From the inside?</i>&rdquo; gasped Bess. &ldquo;Do you think
he&rsquo;s been hiding in one of the trunks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan showed her quickly that the knob of the
spring lock was on the inside of the trunk-room
door. One could easily get out of the room without
a key.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But for goodness&rsquo; sake!&rdquo; cried Bess. &ldquo;Tell me
how he got in here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I am going to show you,&rdquo; said her
chum, laughing. As they walked down the long
room, Nan snapping on a light here and there to
show the way, she told her chum about the movable
part of the partition and how she had made the
discovery.</p>

<p>Bess&rsquo; interest and curiosity was roused to the
highest point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you, Nan Sherwood?&rdquo; Bess cried.
&ldquo;There is an underground passage down to the
boathouse!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just see,&rdquo; agreed Nan.</p>

<p>They pushed down the movable part of the partition.
It was dark inside, and dank, and there was a
musty smell. Once assured that there was nothing
supernatural about the black figure they had seen,
Bess was as brave as a lion. She ran for a lantern
which she knew was in the scullery, lit it, and
brought it to Nan, who sat on the door over the
mysterious well. By the light of the lantern the
chums saw a flight of stone steps cut in the very<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
rock of the bluff on which Lakeview Hall stood
leading downward into a seemingly bottomless,
walled pit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the smugglers&rsquo; path to the boathouse!&rdquo;
Bess declared eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; cried Bess, pouting, &ldquo;I bet
this is the way the boy went down. And came up,
too, to frighten Mrs. Cupp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; agreed Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he want to frighten her for?&rdquo; demanded
Bess. &ldquo;Did you hear what he said about
his money? Maybe he&rsquo;s crazy. Oh, my!&rdquo; and
Bess hesitated with her foot on the top step.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he is, we two can manage him,&rdquo; said Nan,
decidedly. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan was sure that the strange boy who had
helped her out of the water more than a week before,
was the figure she and Bess had seen in the
boathouse, and who had chased Mrs. Cupp the
night of the boathouse party.</p>

<p>Why he was hanging about the school, and was
troubling Mrs. Cupp and her sister, Miss Sadie
Vane, was explained by the story Susan had told
Laura Polk about the boy who had been &ldquo;Miss
Vane&rsquo;s bond-slave.&rdquo; Nan could imagine grim Miss
Vane being very severe with boys; nor did Mrs.
Cupp love them.</p>

<p>Nan and Bess went down the long flight of subterranean<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
stairs, quite as long, of course, as the outside
steps down the face of the bluff. They finally
came to an unsuspected cellar under the unused
portion of the boathouse. There was a trap in the
ceiling of this cellar, and it was open. Bess held
the light and Nan reached up, took hold of the edges
of the hole, and drew herself up into the room.
Then she stooped down and gave her hand to Bess,
who quickly came up with the lantern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great!&rdquo; gasped the eager Bess. &ldquo;If Mrs. Cupp
knew we were doing this, she&rsquo;d have a sure-enough
&lsquo;conniption,&rsquo; as Laura calls it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My! I hadn&rsquo;t thought of that,&rdquo; Nan said doubtfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on,&rdquo; cried the more reckless Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;we&rsquo;ve come, so far, we might as well see
it through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then they heard excited voices outside.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; whispered Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Walter&rsquo;s voice!&rdquo; Nan exclaimed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that squeally one is the ghost&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Bess declared.</p>

<p>The two girls ran to the side door. It, likewise,
was unlocked. On the step, Walter Mason held the
smaller boy so that he could not get away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, girls!&rdquo; was Walter&rsquo;s greeting. &ldquo;Why,
Nan! I&rsquo;m glad to see you out again. But what are
you doing down here at the boathouse? And who
is this chap I just caught coming out?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[234]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ghost,&rdquo; cried Bess, giggling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t no ghost,&rdquo; protested the boy in black,
shivering in the cold. He wore no overcoat, his
shoes were broken, and his hands uncovered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ghost?&rdquo; repeated Walter, puzzled. &ldquo;Is he
what frightened you girls around here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Mrs. Cupp! Oh, he frightened her awfully!&rdquo;
cried Bess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care! she was mean to me,&rdquo; declared
the boy. &ldquo;And Miss Vane tied my hands and
feet to a chair and made me sit up all night in the
dark. And now a feller who used to live at the poor
farm and who I met when I ran away from Miss
Vane told me that some money had been left me
by my father&rsquo;s uncle. And Miss Vane and Mrs.
Cupp&rsquo;s got it, I don&rsquo;t doubt!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; asked Nan, softly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be
afraid of us. If we can, we will help you. Bring
him inside, Walter. It isn&rsquo;t as cold here as it is out
of doors. Do come in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Hiram Pease,&rdquo; said the strange boy, plainly
glad to tell his tale to anybody who showed sympathy.
&ldquo;Miss Vane took me from the poor farm.
I&rsquo;m an orphan. She treated me real mean. And
I don&rsquo;t like Mrs. Cupp, either. I don&rsquo;t see how you
girls stand her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess she likes girls better than she does boys,&rdquo;
said Nan, quietly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I bet they have got that money from<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
my great uncle, and I want it!&rdquo; exclaimed Hiram,
who seemed to be of a rather vindictive nature, and
not a very pleasant person. He was underfed, undersized,
and unhealthy looking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How have you lived here all this time?&rdquo; cried
Nan, pitying the boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I stole some of that stuff you girls had for your
party,&rdquo; replied Hiram Pease, grinning. &ldquo;And I
took other things. I found that flight of steps up
into the cellar of the Hall. So I could get to the
kitchen at night.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then I worked around for some of the
folks that live up on the back road; and others gave
me things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I guess you helped yourself to some of my
pigeons and squabs,&rdquo; put in Walter, with some disgust.
&ldquo;I found where you roasted them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! I had to eat somehow,&rdquo; pleaded Hiram,
in defense. &ldquo;And if I ever get my money, I&rsquo;ll pay
you back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll we do with him?&rdquo; asked Walter, of the
girls.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You take him home and feed him and give him
an old overcoat to wear,&rdquo; said the practical Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And let him tell your father about his money&mdash;if
<i>that&rsquo;s</i> true,&rdquo; said Nan, more doubtfully. &ldquo;Your
father is a lawyer. He will know just what to
do.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;All right!&rdquo; cried Walter, again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that.
Come on, Hiram Beans&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right. Peas or Beans&mdash;what&rsquo;s the odds?&rdquo;
said Walter, laughing. &ldquo;What Nan says to do is
always right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys departed, and then the chums hurried
back to the hall by the subterranean passage. Nobody
had discovered their absence; but afterward
they told Dr. Prescott about their adventure, and
the door in the partition between the trunk-room
and the well was nailed up.</p>
<hr class="l1" />
<p><span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>A GREAT SURPRISE</small></h2>


<p>The girls all admitted that it was the very strangest
thing that could possibly have happened! The
Hall did not seem like itself. The students stood
around in groups and talked about it. The reckless
ones took advantage of it and did almost as they
pleased. The more conscientious pupils said: &ldquo;We
must help Dr. Beulah all we can by being particularly
good just now.&rdquo; The younger pupils went
past a certain closed door behind the main stairway
on the first floor on their tiptoes and with
hushed voices.</p>

<p>For four whole days nobody saw Mrs. Cupp
about Lakeview Hall!</p>

<p>The girls were told that private business had
called her away. But some of the older ones, especially
friends of Nan and Bess, knew that it was
Miss Vane&rsquo;s business, and not the matron&rsquo;s that
had called the latter away. Mr. Mason had gone
into court on behalf of young Hiram Pease, made
the town farm authorities show cause why they had
ever bound the boy out to Miss Vane, the village
milliner, and made rather pointed inquiries as to<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>
what had become of the legacy that Hiram&rsquo;s great
uncle had left him.</p>

<p>In the end the local paper told all about it. And,
really, there was nothing in the story to hurt Mrs.
Cupp&rsquo;s reputation, and the only fact brought out in
the testimony against Miss Vane was that the maiden
lady had not understood boys, and had been so
harsh to Hiram that he had run away and for more
than six months had haunted the old boathouse below
Lakeview Hall, living precariously on what he
could pilfer here and there.</p>

<p>In the end, Hiram&rsquo;s affairs were straightened
out and a kindly clergyman was made guardian
of the boy during his minority. He was to have an
education and a chance to be like other boys. Mrs.
Cupp came back to her duties as grim as ever, and
nobody dared to question her about it, least of all
any of the girls.</p>

<p>The Christmas holidays were approaching, and
Grace Mason brought an invitation from her
mother for Nan Sherwood and Bess Harley to
spend a portion of the vacation at the Mason home
in Chicago. Bess accepted eagerly, for the Masons
were very delightful people, and an invitation to
their town house was a compliment indeed.</p>

<p>Nan, however, answered no. &ldquo;I am sure I cannot
do it, Gracie,&rdquo; she said, over and over again. &ldquo;I
have to meet my father and mother when they come
back from Scotland, and go home to Tillbury with<span class="pagenum">[239]</span>
them. And&mdash;and my school days are quite, quite
ended. I shall have to begin to think of more serious
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She would give Walter no more satisfaction,
either. Even when Mrs. Mason wrote a personal
note to Nan, repeating the invitation, the girl could
only write in return that she saw no possibility of
circumstances allowing her to be with her friends
in Chicago during the holidays.</p>

<p>This only goes to show how little we really know
in this world of what is to happen to us, even in the
immediate future; for if the reader cares to learn
what actually happened to Nan and her friends that
very vacation at the Mason city home, she need
only read the next volume of this series, entitled:
&ldquo;Nan Sherwood&rsquo;s Winter Holidays; Or, Rescuing
the Runaways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How such a change came about in Nan&rsquo;s plans
and circumstances, was a great surprise, indeed.</p>

<p>The end of the term was in sight. Nan had
caught up in her missed studies and her standing
was very satisfactory, indeed. Dr. Prescott had
praised her for her record.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall be as sorry to lose you, my dear, as any
pupil I ever had,&rdquo; declared the preceptress. &ldquo;And
I still hope that some way may be found to make
possible the continuation of your course here at the
Hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That had pleased Nan immensely; but she had no<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>
hope of the principal&rsquo;s wish coming true. She tried
to keep her record high to the very last day, not
even neglecting Professor Krenner&rsquo;s lectures upon
architectural drawing.</p>

<p>Amelia and Nan attended the last of these one
afternoon at the professor&rsquo;s cabin, up the lake shore.
They skated up the cove to the strait behind the
Isle of Hope. In warm weather the girls sometimes
went picnicking to the Isle of Hope. It was
a rocky eminence thrust out of the lake, half a mile
off the mainland.</p>

<p>Professor Krenner&rsquo;s cabin was a very cozy place&mdash;a
single big room, with a fireplace at either end in
which the flames now leaped ruddily among the
birch sticks, and with a corner cut off with Navajo
blankets for a bedroom. One side wall was hung
with the professor&rsquo;s drawings; the one opposite with
many cured skins of birds and beasts, for the professor
was a taxidermist.</p>

<p>When the work of the architectural drawing
class was over, Professor Krenner took his silver
bugle down from the wall and went outside with
the girls to wake the echoes on the Isle of Hope.
He had just lifted the bugle to his lips and sent the
first call ringing across the ice:</p>

<p>Ta-ra! ta-ra! ta-ra-ra-ra! Ta-<i>rat!</i> when Amelia
seized Nan by the arm and cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! who&rsquo;s coming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all looked down the strait. A figure in a<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
red cap was dashing up the ice at great speed, and
waving a tippet in a most excited manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; gasped Nan. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bess!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went down to the shore to meet Nan&rsquo;s
chum. Bess rushed up to them and threw herself
into Nan&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess! Guess what&rsquo;s happened, Nan Sherwood!&rdquo;
she fairly shrieked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; gasped Nan, actually turning
pale.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to! You&rsquo;ve got to guess! It&rsquo;s the
very wonderfulest thing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Wonderfulest&rsquo;?&rdquo; murmured &ldquo;Procrastination
Boggs.&rdquo; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new one. I&rsquo;m going to look it
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t guess, Bess,&rdquo; said Nan again, weakly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got to leave Lakeview Hall!&rdquo; cried
the delighted Bess. &ldquo;You are coming back next
term!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nan&rsquo;s color came back. She sighed and wiped
her eyes. But she shook her head slowly. &ldquo;No,
dear, I told you before I could not accept your
father&rsquo;s help. It would not be right,&rdquo; said Nan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense! Who said anything about that?&rdquo;
demanded Bess, in disgust. &ldquo;I heard &rsquo;em talking
about it! Things are all right! Your folks have
got some money after all! And they sent me after
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who sent you after me?&rdquo; suddenly cried Nan,<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>
seizing the reckless and excited Bess by the shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! oh! ouch! Dr. Beulah, of course!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; demanded Nan, exasperated, and
fairly shaking her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;&mdash;Oh! didn&rsquo;t I tell you? Nan <i>dear!</i>
Your father! And your mother! They have just
arrived from Scotland, and they are waiting for you
now in Dr. Beulah&rsquo;s office!&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="l2" />

<p>Joy never kills&mdash;that is sure. But when she was
folded in &ldquo;Momsey&rsquo;s&rdquo; arms, and &ldquo;Papa Sherwood&rdquo;
stood by waiting his turn to hug his plucky little
daughter, Nan really thought her heart would
burst, it beat so hard.</p>

<p>It was not until later that she heard about the
money, or cared to ask about it. Her parents had
settled their business in Scotland so suddenly and
had left for the United States so hurriedly, that
they could send no further news about the settlement
of Hughie Blake&rsquo;s legacy.</p>

<p>Under the Scotch law, no matter how many
times a man has been married or how many children
he has, he can will his personal property as he
pleases. The two women who claimed the Laird
of Emberon&rsquo;s steward as their parent could fight
in the courts for possession of his real estate only;
and most of the wealth Hughie Blake had amassed
was in cash-in-bank.<span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>Therefore Mr. and Mrs. Sherwood came home
amply supplied with funds and the possibility of
poverty for the family retreated below the horizon
for the time being, at least.</p>

<p>Mr. Sherwood purposed going into business at
once, and Nan could return to Lakeview Hall at the
opening of the succeeding term. Meanwhile the
present term came to a happy conclusion, and Nan
and Bess looked forward with gleeful expectation
to their visit to Chicago immediately after Christmas.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
